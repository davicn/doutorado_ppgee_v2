Photic stimulation was completed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern lacking in the Typical wave forms of an awake adult. It is relatively low voltage and featureless with frequent high amplitude slow spike and wave activity of approximately 2-3 Hz. In addition, there is predominant polyspike activity, focal epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, frontal central, and some isolated discharges from the left. There is likely 1 seizure in this EEG during photic stimulation, but after the 7 Hz stimulation concludes when the Patient has a burst of alpha frequency activity on the right with head turning to the left.\\\\nHR: 96bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: markedly ABNORMAL EEG due to:\\\\n1. Absence of normal wave forms for an adult of this age.\\\\n2. High amplitude spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave activity.\\\\n3. Focal activity more prominent on the right, but seen independently from the left.\\\\n4.

Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm. A subtle breech rhythm is noted with higher amplitude activity in the right posterior quadrant than the left.\\\\nThe overall EEG is of low voltage, but there is focal delta noted in the right hemisphere with 1 to 2.5 Hz delta in the right central region and sometimes posterior temporal region as well. The focal slowing is accentuated by hyperventilation. Drowsiness also seems to increase the focal slowing in terms of field of spread and its persistence. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.\\\\nPhotic stimulation does not activate the record.\\\\nHR: 90 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to focal delta in the right hemisphere, particularly in the central and posterior temporal regions.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies.

The patient was recorded during lethargy and confusion.  Activating procedures were not performed.\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no longer posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient appears to be awake and no clear sleep architecture is seen.  There is variability and reactivity to the EEG.  No activating procedures were performed.\\\\nAbnormal Discharges:\\\\nFocal sharp waves seen over the right hemisphere mainly at T4 and at T6, independently at P4 and O2.\\\\nFocal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 40-60 microvolts.  This is associated with increased asymmetric amplitude and beta over that region consistent with a breach rhythm.\\\\nGeneralized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and continuously throughout the recording.\\\\nSeizures:  None.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent right posterior quadrant sharp waves and breach as well as focal slowing in that region in the setting of generalized slowing.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right posterior quadrant region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in that region, which is consistent with the known previous lesion and surgery in that region.  No seizures were clearly seen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",
       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old woman with CPA angle lesion, history of seizures; EEG monitoring requested.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Unknown.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is no seizure log, no report of medications, and overall no clinical history was provided.  The patient is observed to be able to move her arm.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is apparently awake, trached in the ICU.  She is able to move one arm.  The EEG demonstrates a pattern of low voltage theta and delta from the left with frequent right temporal sharp and slow wave complexes, which demonstrate a subtle evolution.  At times, they are periodic and at times there is background suppression from the right or in a generalized fashion, last seen up to two seconds.\\\\nThere are events characterized by movement of the left arm.\\\\n#1 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 9:32:42 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 The EEG demonstrates the preexisting pattern of right temporal sharp activity with in fact less in the way of frequency evolution in comparison to the other portions of the record.  The nurses push the button for this same activity at 15:04 and 15:27.  Upon reviewing the video for these events, no change in the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s clinical status can be identified and movement of the left arm can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be identified in the video.\\\\n#2 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 16:15 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 At this time, an identical event such as that described above is seen.  The background EEG is much more suppressed and there is frequent poly spike and spike and slow wave activity but not significantly different than the other portions of the record. Although there is no report of CNS-acting medications, by 16:19:05 the background EEG is becoming increasingly suppressed.  The background from the left is low voltage with a mixture of delta and theta.  From the right, there are ongoing spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave discharges, periodic activity, and less in the way of frequency evolution.  This is followed by increasing quantities of fast activity particularly in the frontal regions.\\\\n#3 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 17:40 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 The nurse is at the bedside.  The patient seems to make eye contact with the nurse at this time.  There is again frequent spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere that is seen almost continuously.\\\\n#4 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 22:39:19 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 There is less in the way of epileptiform activity in the background and the background is lower voltage and more continuous.  This pattern is again identified between 1:00 and 2:00 AM.  There is a pause in the record between 1:51 AM and 10:31, but the EEG at the close of the record is low voltage with ongoing spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere, maximum in the mid-to-anterior temporal region with a generous field of spread.\\\\nHR:  96 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: This 24-hour section of the record is abnormal due to:\\\\nOngoing epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere, sometimes with frequency evolution.\\\\nSignificant variability in the record with some portions of the record showing more discontinuity and more beta frequency activity, suggestive of administration of CNS medications.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: The clinical behaviors were not associated with a significant change in the amount of epileptiform activity in the record.

There is no clinical history provided.  The patient remains intubated. There are no notes in the event list to indicate that any individual caring for this patient thought that the patient was experiencing seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record demonstrate ongoing spike and slow wave activity, poly spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere, maximum in the temporal regions and an overall low voltage and suppressed pattern.  By 17:57, electrode integrity is compromised. By 1800 hours, the epileptiform activity is lower voltage and less prominent, however, the overall quality of the EEG has deteriorated substantially.\\\\nHR:  108 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal 48-hour bedside EEG monitoring due to:\\\\nOngoing spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave activity, PLEDS, and rhythmic, evolving epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere maximum in the right temporal region.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: While this activity appears to have decreased in the second 24 hours, the quality of the electrodes may provide false information.

She has nearly continuous, rhythmic delta activity despite significant movement and other artifacts.  This seems to be maximum in the temporal regions, right greater than left, with right anterior temporal sharp and slow wave activity.  When the patient is able to rest comfortably, this is prominent, but if she moves about, it becomes more difficult to define.\\\\nSEIZURE DATE & TIME 2/12/03 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 23:19: The patient is asleep. In sleep, there is nearly continuous right temporal focal slowing with sharp waves.  The sharp waves are in trains in sleep.  The activity starts out with continuous focal delta from the right temporal region, with a generous field of spread and frequent sharp and slow wave activity.  As the activity continues, some of it seems to spread to involve the left temporal region.  The patient remains asleep through this relatively prolonged discharge with brief arousals at 23:20:47. At 23:20:57, again a brief alerting is identified by the EEG with eye movement and intermittent posterior dominant rhythm.\\\\nThe patient is briefly awake at 23:19:18.  At 23:19:38, again the same rhythmic, repetitive sharp waves and rhythmic right temporal delta is identified.  By 23:22:38, the activity seems to be spreading to the left temporal region.  There is an arousal associated with this.  The arousal seems to terminate the epileptiform activity and none of the typical clinical correlates that were seen with the other seizures with moaning, brief stiffening, and posturing on the left with circular movements on the right were seen.  By 23:24:29, this same rhythmic, right temporal slowing and sharp activity has returned.  This remains through until the close of the epoch at 23:28.\\\\nSEIZURE DATE & TIME 2/13/03 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 1:19 and 1:22:08 AM: The patient is asleep.  There is a nurse at the bedside and the nurse has noted that intermittently the patient appears to be confused during the course of the night, but does not really understand how to test the patient.  At 1:21, there is delta activity in the T1-T2 electrodes bilaterally.  The patient seems to be in a very light stage of sleep.  At 1:21:20, the patient stirs from sleep. She is sleeping on her left side, she moans and lifts her head.  She looks to the right.  She makes circular movements with her right arm and her left arm remains postured as was seen in other seizures.  Despite significant amounts of muscle and movement artifact underneath this, there is rhythmic activity.  By 1:21:39, there is clear-cut ictal activity and this includes 7 Hz activity, which is identified in the temporal regions.  Because of the electrode artifacts described above, it is not adequately localized.  The patient is lying back.  She is not moving the left arm until 1:21:48.  When she does move the left arm, the left hand is in a clenched posture.  She sits up at 1:22:51. The nurse rubs the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulders, but doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to realize that the patient has had a seizure.  The patient lies down and drifts off to sleep.  The EEG at 1:24:40 demonstrates diffuse, high amplitude delta compatible with a postictal state.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this portion of the record, the patient has had some seizures earlier in the day. She doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t recall the seizures and she is somewhat slightly confused prior to the onset of the seizure.\\\\nSEIZURE DATE & TIME 2/13/03 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 17:08: As the seizure begins to trace, the patient is off camera.  She has the same vocalizations as seen in previous seizures at 17:08:20.  Unfortunately, at the start of the seizure, the EEG becomes obscured with muscle and movement artifact, which lasts 17 seconds in duration.  Even with the use of HFF, the EEG is difficult to resolve, but there does appear to be some rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity in the T2-T4 electrodes seen as early as 17:08:26.  By 17:08:37, there is a more clear-cut ictal pattern.  There is rhythmic, repetitive, alpha/theta frequency activity, which is intense on the right mid-to-anterior temporal region and slower frequency activity, 3 to 4 Hz from the left temporal region. This activity is clearly maximum in the temporal regions, but does involve the right central parietal region at 17:08:43.  The patient remains off camera throughout the seizure.  By 17:08:50, both hemispheres demonstrate rhythmic 6 to 8 Hz activity, most intense in the temporal region.  The activity seems to be slowing a bit by 17:09.  At 17:09:20, it is clearly slowing to delta frequency activity in the T1-T2 electrodes.  The seizure appears to be over by 17:09:40 for a total seizure duration of approximately 1 minute 20 seconds.  In the postictal section, the patient remains off camera.  The background shows significant slowing as well as artifact.  By 17:10:39, she is successfully removing her electrodes, which was an identical behavior to her other seizures.  No additional viable recording is possible to identify after this.  There are remaining electrodes seen, but the quality of the record is compromised.\\\\nHR:  96 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION FOR LTM: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:\\\\nMultiple complex partial seizures with similar behavioral correlates but without clear scalp lateralization or localization.  The seizures were generally stereotypic in terms of complex partial in terms of the behavior; however, unfortunately because of the stiffening, the initial 10 to 15 seconds were obscured.  When there is scalp lateralization or localization, the localization seems to be right temporal and the later behavior would support a focus from the right hemisphere, although the early behavior didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t always identify this with either moaning or on one occasion sitting up abruptly and clenching of the hands.\\\\nIndependent right anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity, which increases dramatically in the time around the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seizures.\\\\nAt points, continuous right temporal focal slowing particularly around the time of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seizures.\\\\nOccasional left temporal spike and slow wave activity and occasional left temporal focal slowing particularly around the times that this patient has experienced seizures.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episodes of left arm burning did not have any EEG correlate.  However, please note that up to 75% of simple partial seizures may not be captured during scalp EEG.  Lastly, the patient did have some EKG abnormalities seen throughout the recording.

Photic stimulation was performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9 to 9.5 Hz in frequency and 40-60 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  The patient had intermittent head jerking from side-to-side during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  There are movement artifact and muscle artifacts distributed diffusely excluding central derivation.  There are frequent bursts of left anterior and mid temporal slowing at F7/T3, in wakefulness consisting of 3 to 3.5 Hz delta frequency lasting from 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to left temporal slowing seen during wakefulness.  Intermittent head movements were captured during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  A left temporal slowing is suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Intermittent head movements without any ictal change on EEG suggestive of this being probably subcortical in origin.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.   The EEG was performed at the laboratory.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic variable amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is weak.  During drowsiness, bursts of theta and attenuation of the posterior dominant are captured.  Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left temporal region.  Moderate to high amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves are captured over the left central region with phase reversal over the C3/T3 electrode.  At approximately 1:35:25 p.m., a 3-second run of 2 Hz of these sharp waves is captured.  Additional independent rare sharp waves and after-going slow waves are captured over the right anterior temporal region with phase reversal over F8 electron.  During drowsiness, a 5-second run at 0.75 Hz is captured over the F8 electrode.  Sharp waves over the O1 electrode are captured during sleep.  These sharp waves are observed during sleep.  Additionally, during sleep, rhythmic approximately 3 Hz brief runs of sharp waves with after-going slow waves are captured over the bilateral central region, more prominent over the left.  Symmetrical sleep spindles are captured.  Temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) is observed over the left.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation did not produce additional abnormalities.\\\\nFINDINGS:\\\\nContinuous moderate left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.\\\\nIndependent epileptiform discharges observed over C3/T3 electrode, O2 electrode, and F8 electrode.

Despite the breach with accentuation of theta from the right, in the initial portions of the record, there is very slow, sharply contoured periodic delta at O2/T6/P4 with a periodicity of 0.45 to 0.75.  Although there is no mention during the record of changes in the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s medications, the periodic delta becomes less high amplitude and less sharply contoured with the treatments that are initiated.

The patient is intubated and sedated.  Noxious stimulation of the patient was performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with attenuation of the left hemisphere and mixed theta and delta frequency background from the right hemisphere.  Five brief clinical seizures are detected in this recording with involuntary movements of the left upper extremity and EEG correlates lasting 50 to 100 seconds, which initially starts out with sharply contoured theta frequency activity.  The right temporal region with sharp waves maximally from the right anterior temporal region shows a phase reversal primarily at T1.  There is clear frequency evolution of those discharges with volume conduction to the left frontal regions.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly alter the record.\\\\nHR:  102 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nOnset of complex partial seizures with onset in the right frontotemporal region with subsequent spread.\\\\nSuppression of EEG activity over the left hemisphere.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: The recurrent seizures  from the right temporal region seen in this recording correlates with the clinical seizures.

An EEG is performed to rule out status epilepticus.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, prednisone, Lovenox, metoprolol, and Protonix. The patient is not getting Versed.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single-EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of approximately 3 second bursts of variable amplitude polymorphic delta activity.  Bursts of activity are generally poorly formed over the right.  Inter-burst interval last approximately 4-7 seconds on average, thus making burst suppression ratio approximately 1:1 to 1:3.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Independent bursts of polymorphic sharply contoured fast activity are captured over the left posterior temporal/posterior quadrant.  Four electrographic seizures are captured.  These seizures all differ electrographically.  The seizures occurred at approximately 11:48 a.m., 11:51 a.m., 12:03 p.m., and 12:38, and last approximately 1 minute 39 seconds, 1 minute 23 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, and approximately 3 minutes and 16 seconds, respectively.  First electrographic seizure starts with moderate amplitude sharply contoured fast activity emanating from the left posterior temporal region.  This activity rapidly evolves into approximately 2.5 Hz rhythmic delta that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency and spreads to the bilateral occipital region.\\\\nSeizure number 2 starts over the left lateral leads either over the left posterior temporal region or left anterior temple region.  Seizure starts with a low amplitude discrete spikes with after-going slow waves that rapidly increase in frequency into the alpha range (approximately 11 Hz activity) and spread throughout the left temporal region and bilateral occipital regions.  This activity gradually decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude, and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  By the end of the seizure, the seizure is characterized by approximately 1 Hz 0.3 second bursts of moderate amplitude, rhythmic, alpha activity.\\\\nSeizure number 3 is similar in appearance and evolution to seizure number 2, however, it starts over the right temporal region.\\\\nSeizure number 4 appears to start over the right anterior temporal/mid temporal region.  It starts with a 5 Hz small amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves that rapidly decrease in frequency.  As the seizure progresses it appears to stop over the right temporal region and start over the left posterior temporal region.  As the seizure progresses it is similar in appearance to seizure number 1.\\\\nThere is no clear clinical correlation with any of the patient\\'s seizures.  There is no clear reactivity to either noxious, tactile, or verbal stimuli.  An irregular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.\\\\nFINDINGS:\\\\nBurst suppression, with burst suppression ratio of approximately 1:1 up to 1:3.\\\\nNear lack of clear bursts over the right temporal region.\\\\nFour discrete electrographic seizures that differ in appearance and emanate from either left posterior temporal region, left anterior temporal region, and right anterior temporal region.\\\\nNo clear evidence of reactivity.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal nearly 24-minute coma EEG due to  1:1 to 1:3 burst suppression, poorly formed bursts over the right temporal region, and 4 discrete electrographic seizures that differ electrographically and that arise from at least 3 distinct cerebral regions.  These findings indicate significant cerebral dysfunction  and if the patient is not sedative medications indicate a poor prognosis of a full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at that time of the review.  The patient will be converted to the long term monitoring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

Previously evaluated in 2010 for similar symptoms.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Plavix, Keppra, others.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.\\\\nHyperventilation was completed.\\\\nThe patient had an event lasting approximately 10 minutes in the EEG lab characterized by moaning with relatively preserved consciousness and repetitive movements of the left hand, and some shaking from side to side.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a bit of shifting asymmetry noted in the posterior regions and a little bit of underlying focal slowing with some slow underlying delta in right posterior region.  Hyperventilation was remarkable for an increase in amplitude of the background.\\\\nEVENTS:  The patient was awake at 9:37.  There is an initial subtle EEG change with a suggestion of an underlying right posterior sharp wave really maximum at T6 in an average reference, but with clear involvement T602 primarily.  This discharge can be attributed to movement artifact, as there is some clear rocking movement noted up until 9:40:45.  Then this activity is quite subtle.  At 9:48:05, the patient seems to have trouble stopping the involuntary movements and there may be some underlying subtle rhythmic slowing despite the artifacts.  At 9:45:29, there is clearly an alpha rhythm that has returned.  When the physician enters to perform testing, the alpha rhythm is present and the patient is able to answer questions. The artifact demonstrates \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfrequency evolution\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHeart rate 66 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:  An indeterminate event.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient had a behavioral event which had many characteristics of a nonepileptic seizure.  Curiously, however, there does appear to be a focal underlying discharge which would be very difficult to attribute to artifact and has some frequency evolution raising the possibility that this is, in fact, a simple partial seizure.  Clinical correlation and additional recording may be necessary to clarify this.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of low to moderate amplitude 9 to 10 Hz alpha with preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.

The patient reports no seizures during this section of the record. None are identified by the clinical team. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium amplitude background. The overall waking record is relatively well-organized particularly in the morning of 9/14/2010. The record continues to demonstrate right occipital sharp waves and spike waves, occasional bifrontal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves.

He also has some frontal sharp and slow wave complexes which are bilateral and more remarkable on the left. There are sections of the record including where he has trains of right occipital sharp waves.\\\\nSeizure Time: 09:32. The patient is in bed. At 09:32:30, he has repetitive spiking from the occipital regions most prominent in the 02 distribution. The spiking is essentially at 5 hertz. At 9:32:38, he has stiffening which his mother is instantly aware of and reaches for the push button. Behavioral aspects of the seizures include lack of movement on the left and tremulousness on the right with coarse respirations. This clinical seizure progresses at 9:33 to tonic clonic activity with focalization just prior to this. The EEG pattern is a tonic clonic pattern and the jerking is slightly asynchronous right shoulder more so than the left. This is a very difficult seizure to localize because of activity and the activity is clearly bilateral by 09:33:18, but it looks like early in his seizure, it may transition from occipital to anterior temporal. The physician comes in at 09:34. By that point, the EEG is transitioning to postictal state. The patient remains tremulous at the end of the seizure. There is some rhythmic activity picked up on the left parasagittal region including the left occipital, but the activity seems to have abated on the right and the right has transitioned to a more of a slow pattern.

It is difficult to find a well-defined alpha rhythm.\\\\nProminent rhythmic theta is noted in the right temporal or occipital region and there are sharp waves noted.\\\\nSleep is characterized by an increase in beta with spindles and arrhythmic delta activity. Sharp waves on this EEG can\\\\nbe posterior, right occipital, anterior temporal or even on one or two occasions right frontal. Epileptiform activity is\\\\naccentuated in sleep and some of it has a bifrontal or more generalized appearance. There are clear stage 2 sleep\\\\nmorphologies. Stage 2 sleep also is associated with some generalized, bifrontal spike and slow wave or polyspike\\\\ncomplexes.\\\\nSeizure number one 16:16:26. The patient is with his mother. He is asleep. In sleep, there is repetitive spiking noted\\\\nfrom the right mid to posterior temporal region.\\\\nThe patient starts to stir from sleep at 16:14:50 and he looks at his mother, which produces an increase in muscle in the\\\\nbackground. He looks about for several seconds and he speaks to his mother, although it is difficult to tell what he said.\\\\nHe gestures with his left hand, puts the left hand to the mouth and looks about. Behaviorally, this seems to be an aura\\\\nbecause he does not seem to be having any clinical symptoms and then his mother goes to get the urinal. No clinical\\\\nmanifestations are noted aside from tremulousness and an urge to go to the bathroom. However, as the patient gets up\\\\nto go to the bathroom, he starts to have jerking at 16:16:30 with jerking, vocalizations and tremulousness. He holds the\\\\nleft hand a bit more still and jerks the right hand He also has characteristic ictal-type respirations.

The patient is awake,\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and opens almost with an ictal pattern with rhythmic high amplitude 3 hertz activity in the right posterior quadrant occipital temporal with generous field of spread. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic delta activity and in fact, seems to generate a seizure during hyperventilation although no clinical symptoms are reported in this non-English speaking adult. The tech does ask the patient, \"how are you feeling\" and he reports that he \"feels okay during the discharge.\"  The remainder of the EEG demonstrates a slow disorganized pattern with rhythmic theta and delta activity with nearly continuous rhythmic sharply contoured activity in the right hemisphere particularly posterior quadrant, mid to posterior temporal. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response.\\\\nHR:    120 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nSeizure from the right hemisphere particularly mid to posterior temporal region with waxing and waning epileptiform activity.\\\\nSharp waves from the right hemisphere including occipital or posterior temporal.\\\\nMarked background slowing.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many patterns for this individual.

Approximately 10 minutes into the recording, EMG artifact disappears.  Once EMG artifact is cleared, the background consists of low to moderate amplitude, generalized frontally predominant, spikes and poly spikes with after-going slow waves that occur at approximately 1.5 to 4 Hz.  These discharges appear both rhythmically and semi-rhythmically.  They do not organize into clear electrographic seizures.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.\\\\nFINDINGS: 1.  Frontally predominant generalized 1.5 to 4 Hz G-PEDs and quasi PEDs.\\\\n2. No clear electrographic Seizures.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute electroencephalogram due to continuous generalized frontally predominant epileptiform discharges that occur rhythmically and semi-rhythmically at approximately 1.5 to 4 Hz.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.  This electroencephalogram pattern indicates high cortical irritability, high risk for status epilepticus and in post anoxic brain injury indicates a poor chance for full neurological recovery.

The patient is quite obtunded but has some cranial nerve findings.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is markedly suppressed. There is a lower voltage subtle, periodic delta with a sharp wave mixed in. This sharp wave is picked up at T2, perhaps maximum at T4-C4. Stimulation of the patient on 1 occasion produces a clear change in the background with rhythmic periodic activity. In addition, there is some sustained periodic discharge in the right hemisphere, which seems to have an admixed right central temporal sharp wave. Looking at the video, it appears that the patient has movement of the right thoracic region in association with this. This discharge is brief and subsides on its own. A second, remarkable discharge is identified with sharp activity present bilaterally but clearly maximum in the right hemisphere. On this occasion, the video does not identify a clinical correlate and this second event is without a doubt an electrographic seizure. In total, there are 3 well-defined electrographic seizures noted in the record. One of them seems to be stimulus sensitive and other 2 did not have clear clinical correlates.\\\\nHR: 120-150 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

The recording begins at 9 a.m. after the patient has had 8 mg Ativan. She is intubated and demonstrates intermittent rhythmic movement of the right hand only. This was a 20 minute baseline and 5 hour EEG.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there Is a fair amount of muscle and motion artifact in the EEG, when the muscle artifact drops out, a lower voltage pattern of a mixture of theta and delta activity can be identified. There is almost a bit of discontinuity with 2 Hz delta activity and scant amount of 6 Hz theta activity. Superimposed upon this is a periodic complex from the right hemisphere maximum in the right frontotemporal and frontocentral regions with an F2 sharp wave.\\\\n\\\\nStimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. Some sections of the record with more muscle artifact are associated with eye movement and unfortunately in these sections of the record, it is difficult to really define the underlying EEG pattern due to the muscle artifact.\\\\n\\\\nAs the recording continues, the epileptiform activity can be identified particularly using an average reference and it is maximum more at F8 than at FT2. Again, each time that the patient has eye movement, it is more challenging to see the EEG, but the eye movements are relatively slower.\\\\n\\\\nPhenobarbital is initiated at 10:54 for a total of 500 mg. This actually produces an increase in overall theta frequency in the record and more of a transition to a more of a rhythmic theta pattern. There are some sharp waves picked up in the left frontal region at 11:58. There is a subtle intermittent discontinuity noted particularly at 2 p.m. The sharp waves are improved despite some muscle artifact as the recording continues. It is not possible to determine if the patient has been twitching later on in the record. Her hand is covered up. By 3:14 when the record stops and she seems to have a little bit more muscle artifact, the sharp waves can be identified but they are not occurring in bursts. The EEG concludes at 3:18.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION: This is a challenging but markedly abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. An initial clinical appearance of seizure characterized by movements of the right hand and repetitive sharp waves in the right.\\\\n2. Marked background slowing.\\\\n3. Very slow pattern seen initially with an improvement to more of a theta frequency pattern following the use of the phenobarbital.\\\\n4.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.\\\\nThe patient had missed his medication on the morning of the study and experienced one of his typical clinical events during this EEG.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  On rare occasions there is a burst of subtle underlying delta noted bilaterally during hyperventilation.  This is a bit more posterior than might be expected.\\\\nSeizure is observed at 08:42:36.  The patient is relaxing after hyperventilation. Prior to the seizure, there is a low voltage beta discharge, maximum at F2 at 8:42:30. He looks to the right.  He looks at the tech.  There is a little bit of facial automatisms and very subtle jerking of the upper extremities, which seem to be right hand more than the left.\\\\nThe first sharp wave associated with this discharge is at 08:46:36 and the overall initial 8 seconds of the seizure seem to be maximum at FZ and CZ, but with a little bit more of a predominance to the left of the midline.

The patient had a seizure just prior to the EEG.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG demonstrates some low voltage, subtlety discontinuous background. Some attenuation of about 3 seconds are interspersed with periods of low voltage, mixed theta delta. As the recording continues, the EEG is more continuous. There is some shifting asymmetries with more attenuation on the left compared to the right.\\\\n\\\\nSeizure: The patient is in the ICU at the bedside. She starts to have rhythmic mixed theta delta out of the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region at 10:36:43. This gradually builds up, but at 10:36:55 she starts to have a burst of fast activity out of the right hemisphere. The bursts of fast activity builds up exquisitely, while the left hemisphere as a different frequency of activity with rhythmic delta. This is followed by more of a generalized pattern characteristic of more of a tonic clonic pattern, although behaviorally the patient is only observed to be having facial and head twitching. The activity starts to slow at 10:37:41. As it stops, it shuts off at 10:38 on the right, but continues on the left before terminating abruptly at 10:38:20. Postictally there is prominent background suppression as was noted in the early portions of the record.\\\\n\\\\nHR: 162 bpm\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. A markedly abnormal background starting out with burst suppression pattern and actually ending with a burst suppression pattern.\\\\n2. A very complex seizure, which likely began on the left, generated to the right, with different frequencies of activity from the different hemispheres and a differential termination of the procedure.\\\\n3. Following the seizure there are handful of sharp waves on the left.\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy, as well as very unusual mechanism for epilepsy.

Per the patient, she has several seizures and migraine headaches in a week.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In a most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8-8.5 Hz in frequency 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of low-amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There is occasional left temporal slowing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and result in slowing of the background.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute.\\\\nIMPRESSION:\\\\nThis is an abnormal EEG recording due to one diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.\\\\nSlowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.\\\\nLeft temporal slowing seen during wakefulness and drowsiness.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication, bilateral cerebral dysfunction, or degenerative brain disease.  The left temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormalities in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or ambulatory EEG monitoring may be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

There is a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm that at times attains 8-9 Hz, but at other times is disrupted by intervening theta activity.  There is excessive muscle artifact throughout the recording.  Brief stage 1 sleep is identified in which there is further slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, decrease in behavior and movement activity and a decrease in eye blinks.  On several epochs throughout the recording there are brief 2 second bursts of what appear to be slow spike wave activity.  These are maximal over the central regions bilaterally.  In addition, there are intermittent sharp waves noted over the left frontal region and rarely over the left central region.  There were no electrographic or clinical seizures identified during the recording epoch.  Activation procedures were not performed. Heart rate varied from 60-80.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION:  In summary, this is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the appearance of bihemispheric slowing, as well as intermittent brief bursts of generalized low spike wave activity and rare sharp waves in the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.  The presence of diffuse slowing and bursts of slow spike wave activity may be seen in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as well as in secondary generalized epilepsy syndromes.  The presence of focal sharp waves in the left frontal and frontocentral region may suggest a structural brain lesion in this region that has epileptiform potential.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The patient is somewhat confused.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is able to answer questions, the background EEG is markedly abnormal. The left hemisphere is somewhat lower voltage. The right hemisphere includes a rhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex in the right frontocentral region with some variability typically C4.\\\\nWhen the patient is asked to count to 10, 8 Hz activity appears out of the right hemisphere. At one point, the pattern almost looks like an alerting but at another point during this, it almost looks as if an ictal pattern is generated during this testing. There is variability in the record with some sections demonstrating more alpha frequency activity than others. The right hemisphere demonstrates a significant breech rhythm.\\\\nThe spike and wave activity has a slower periodicity demonstrating some waxing and waning but its alpha theta frequency activity which may represent an ictal pattern for this individual versus an arousal. Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record.\\\\nHR: 84 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right central region.\\\\n2. Questionable subclinical seizures characterized by more rhythmic delta theta from the right and/or perhaps a pattern of more rhythmic alpha theta frequency activity.\\\\n3. Relatively lower voltage featureless pattern on the right.\\\\n4.

During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset.\\\\nFrequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions.\\\\nThe patient\\\\\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.\\\\nAfter this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\'',\n",

Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate.\\\\nContinuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;\\\\nThe EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;\\\\nThe full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient\\\\\\'s exam\\\\nthere have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a \"low risk\" service\\\\nConditions of the recording:\\\\nA routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.

Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate.\\\\nContinuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;\\\\nThe EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;\\\\nThe full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient\\\\\\'s exam\\\\nthere have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a \"low risk\" service\\\\nConditions of the recording:\\\\nA routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.

CPS\\\\nEPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:\\\\n1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the right hemisphere likely from the occipital region.\\\\nCONCLUSION:\\\\nadmitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG. During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset.\\\\nFrequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions.\\\\nThe patient\\\\\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.\\\\nAfter this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\'',\n",

Nursing\\\\xc2\\\\xad initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.  All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.\\\\n# Push button events\\\\nDescription of pushbutton events\\\\nDescription:\\\\nThere is no PDR or AP gradient. The background is diffusely attenuated with slow polymorphic delta activity captured. There are frequent right anterior temporal seizures. They last - 30 seconds.\\\\nOccasional right midtemporal seizures are also captured. These are longer (example, 1:35:30 AM) . Neither seizure type have clinical correlate. Continuous low amplitude sharp waves are captured over T4 lead.  No normal sleep architecture is present.\\\\nSummary of Findings:\\\\nSeizure, frequent, right temporal, anterior\\\\nSecondary bilateral synchrony , occasional, right temporal, mid Diffuse slowing, polymorph ic, severe\\\\nAttenuation, severe\\\\nInterpretation:\\\\nThis is an ABNORMAL continuous 13 hour video EEG due to (1) severe background slowing and attenuation; (2) frequent right anterior temporal and occasional right midtemporal seizures and (3) continuous very focal right midtemporal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing and attenuation are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that, in this case is at least partially related to the medication effect. There is focal irritable epileptogenic, likely structural, focus over the right anterior temporal - midtemporal region.

NMS, Hepatitis cirrhosis\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Ativan, Seroquel, Keppra, Phenobarbital\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:\\\\nDay #1: March 23 through March 24, 2011: The patient is moving about quite a bit. The overall background is relatively low voltage and slow. Using an average reference, a period complex can be identified in the occipital regions much more so from the right than from the left in the right posterior quadrant but with some volume conduction to the left. The accompanying background EEG includes some fast activity and some low voltage theta. The patient is frequently awake moving about. He appears to have been intubated prior to the baseline EEG. As the record continues in the first day, the patient is awake and relatively interactive. This triangularly shaped sharp wave in the right posterior quadrant persists and is sometimes picked up on the left. It is best seen in the averaged reference and it continues to have somewhat of a phase reversal on the right central parietal region. Review of this discharge in other montages really highlights its electronegativity in the most posterior regions.\\\\nHR: 130 bpm\\\\nDay #2 - March 26 through March 27. 2011: This section of the record continues to demonstrate a slow pattern with a right occipital, periodic sharp wave. The periodic sharp activity is lower voltage. The EEG continues to demonstrate attenuation in the background. By the late night of the 26th, the EEG demonstrates a much more attenuated periodic complex. In the overnight recording, the complex is seen again but no longer evolves. There are some aspects with problematic electrode but by and large the epileptiform activity when present can be identified.\\\\nThe EEG concludes on the afternoon of the 27th and despite some artifacts it is still possible to see some of the activity. Unfortunately the P4 electrode has been lost. It is possible to identify the periodic complex in the right occipital region, although it is much improved.\\\\nHR: 130bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: This continuous video EEG monitoring sessions is remarkable for a PLEDS Plus right pathology in the right occipital region which clearly improves over the 48 hour EEG monitoring.

Intermittent underlying focal slowing was noted in the left central temporal region and was clearly accentuated by hyperventilation.  In addition, there was some shifting and slowing also accentuated by hyperventilation.  In this sharply contoured record, as the patient transitions in and out of stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles, there are a handful of sharp waves noted in the left central temporal region with an after going slow wave.  Other features of the drowsy record include an accentuation of the focal slowing in the left hemisphere including frontocentral and posterior temporal regions with attenuation of activity in drowsiness in the left frontocentral region.\\\\nPhotic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off into stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.\\\\nHeart rate:  60 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nLeft hemispheric focal slowing with variable maxima depending on whether the patient is awake, asleep or performing hyperventilation.\\\\nIn the context of a breech rhythm and a sharply contoured record, there are a handful of sharp waves with after going slow waves in the left mid temporal region.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are congruent with a structural process on the left as well as a breech rhythm.

The patient was recorded during lethargy and confusion.  No activating procedures were performed.   Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses\\' notes as well as patient alarms were used to review the EEG.\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last 8 hours of the recording, there was multiple electrode artifact as they were detached.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record remains without background which has a very seldom posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz.  There are no activating procedures and there is some frontal central beta seen.  Overall, however, is mainly diffusely slow and a theta 5-7 Hz frequency.  Some sleep architecture can be seen.\\\\nABNORMAL DISCHARGES:\\\\nFocal sharp waves seen continuously at T5 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz in a monomorphic fashion consistent with periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).\\\\nFocal slow waves are seen over the left hemisphere, maximal at T5 continuously throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.\\\\nGeneralized slow waves at 5-7 Hz is seen throughout the recording continuously.\\\\nSEIZURES:  The patient had multiple electrographic seizures that would appear to arise from the left hemisphere, maximally over the posterior temporal region at T5 intervals and a delta rhythmic discharge that increases in frequency and amplitude and becomes better formed until it suddenly stops.  This first seizure occurred at 10:43:18 a.m. and ended at 10:45 a.m. A second similar seizure occurred at 4:21:57 p.m. and ended at 4:25:51 p.m. and the last seizure occurred around 10:50 p.m.  At that point, multiple electrodes had been lost which made it difficult to evaluate the origin of the seizure but appeared to be similar to the other ones.

Her seizures are felt to be secondary to AVM.\\\\n\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.\\\\n\\\\nCONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Seizure detection software was activated.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is significant right to left interhemispheric asymmetry, with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.  During maximal wakefulness, the background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta without expected posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with additional polymorphic delta over the right temporal region.  No posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is observed over the left hemisphere.  During sleep, sleep spindle-like complexes are captured.  Continuous moderate amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves are captured over the left posterior temporal region.  Intermittently throughout the recording, these discharges occur rhythmically at approximately 1 to 2 Hz and correspond to periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.  Approximately 8 electrographic seizures are captured.  They start with increasing frequency epileptiform discharges, and rapidly evolve into rhythmic theta and later alpha, most prominent over the left posterior quadrant.  As seizure progresses, these discharges spread throughout the left hemisphere and decrease in frequency to about 3.5 Hz delta range.  These seizures last approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  There is no clinical correlate that is evident from the video review.  From approximately 4 p.m. until approximately 5:30 p.m., several leads are intermittently disconnected.  This limits interpretation of the EEG during that time period.\\\\n\\\\nFINDINGS:\\\\n1. Focal left hemispheric slowing.\\\\n2. Frequent left posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges that intermittently organize into 1 to 2 Hz PLEDS.\\\\n3. Approximately 8 electrographic seizures that start over the left posterior quadrant and spread throughout the left hemisphere.  These seizures do not have a clear clinical correlate.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio-video EEG due to:\\\\n1. Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.\\\\n2. Focal left hemispheric slowing.\\\\n3. Frequent left posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges that are frequently periodic.\\\\n4. Approximately 8 electrographic seizures lasting 3 to 4 minutes with onset over the left posterior quadrant.\\\\n\\\\nDiffuse slowing indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in this case could partially be related to the medication effect.  Focal left hemispheric slowing and epileptiform discharges indicate structural pathology over that region that has high epileptogenic potential.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left posterior quadrant.  When compared to the EEG from the prior 24 hours, there has been no significant change in the degree of the background slowing or frequency of seizures or epileptiform discharges.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

However, this is not clearly seen as the video was focused on the right side of his body.  In the EEG, there is muscle artifact seen maximally over the left hemisphere in a rhythmic high-frequency fashion.  However, it is not clear if there is any appreciable discharge over the right hemisphere as there is too much muscle artifact and before the seizures started, the patient was eating which makes it even more difficult to localize or clearly identify a seizure onset.  The seizure lasted for the duration of approximately 1 minute, 45 seconds.  After the seizure, the patient was back to baseline.  No other seizures were seen.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to single seizure of unclear onset, likely arising from the right hemisphere and focal slowing in the right temporal region.

Nursing-\\\\ninitiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed\\\\nat least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All\\\\nautomatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.  The Gotman\\\\nspike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real time for\\\\nelectrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.\\\\n# Push button events\\\\nDescription of pushbutton events\\\\nDescription:\\\\nAwake background is characterized by low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity with preserved AP\\\\ngradient.  PDR is subtly slower over the left occipital region.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.\\\\nDuring sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.\\\\nThere are frequent clinical and electrographic focal seizures early in the recording (status\\\\nepilepticus).  Their frequency gradually decreases and last clear seizure is captured at ~ 1:49 AM\\\\non 1/24/2015.  Seizures start with very low amplitude fast activity over the O1 electrode. This\\\\nactivity rapidly spreads to O2 electrode.  It also increases in amplitude, decreases in frequency and\\\\nspreads over the left parietal and posterior temporal region.  Gradually, there is diffuse semi-\\\\nrhythmic monomorphic theta activity.  Seizures on average last ~ 2 minutes.  A good seizure\\\\nexample is at 6:54 PM on 1/23/2015.

This finding\\\\nis indicative of an epileptogenic likely structural focus in the  left occipital region.  Last clear seizure is captured at ~ 1:49 AM on 1/24/2015  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the\\\\nmedication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

Wakefulness and sleep were captured.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a bilateral alpha rhythm which is about 9.5 Hz on the left hemisphere, but it is disrupted on the right hemisphere.  There is bifrontal slowing more pronounced on the right hemisphere.  The slowing is frequently sharply contoured.  Sleep was characterized by vertex waves and K complexes.  The right focal slowing was more pronounced during sleep.\\\\nThere were discreet sharps on the right hemisphere in the FP2 region and rarely in T2 region.\\\\nHyperventilation was performed which showed diffuse slowing of the record with increase in amplitude.\\\\nPhotic stimulation was performed which did not show any changes in the EEG record.\\\\nHeart rate 84 beats per minute.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nBifrontal slowing.\\\\nRight focal slowing with disrupted alpha on the right side.

Diffuse slowing indicates neurologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal cerebral slowing is suggestive of underlying focal cerebral dysfunction.  Excess beta is secondary to medication effect such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines.

       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed male admitted to Nursing Facility due to Dilantin toxicity who presented yesterday to the Outpatient Neurology Clinic with report of 3 seizures and proceeded to have complex partial seizures in the office with a return to the baseline, now admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for complex partial status epilepticus.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tylenol.\\\\nREASON FOR EEG:  Rule out status.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Long-term digital video EEG was performed at bedside for 12 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system and additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  Seizure spike detection software was used along with nursing reports of events and review of the EEG.\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At the onset of the EEG, there was an increased amount of movement artifact.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the onset of record, the background appeared to be mildly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz but appears to be reactive to eye opening and closing.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Patient during the recording does go into the first stages of sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.\\\\nABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  In the recording, there are, specifically at the beginning, frequent focal sharp waves seen at T4/T6, at times moving more anteriorly to T2/F8.  In addition, there are infrequent O2 sharp waves and T1/F7 sharp waves are also seen.  The sharp waves at times appear to become rhythmic without evolution, specifically the ones on the T2/T6 electrode.\\\\nSEIZURES:  Multiple seizures were seen at the beginning of the recording that appeared to be arising mainly from the right temporal region, specifically at the T4/T6 electrodes.  However, sometimes the seizures appeared to start or spike quickly to the left temporal region and it is difficult or unclear to note the onset.  At times, they also appeared to ping-pong from the right to the left hemisphere in the temporal region before stopping and starting.  The patient appeared to move around in bed, sometimes rhythmically  moving the right hand during the events and staring, but if talked to, would be able to answer questions simply.  After about 10:50 p.m. the seizures subsided and only about 3 of them were seen which were all arising from the right temporal region.  The last one was noted this morning around the end of the recording.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nRight more than left temporal lobe seizures.\\\\nRight temporal sharp waves.\\\\nRight posterior temporal occipital sharp waves.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term EEG revealed evidence of partial status epilepticus arising from the temporal lobes.  The seizures, however, subsequently markedly reduced in number after two hours into the recording.  In addition, there was evidence of bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The patient received Ativan and a Depakote load and then an Ativan drip.\\\\nHer last clinical seizure was noted at 3:00 p.m. on February 22, 2012.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As said record starts the patient is intubated.  She has a fair amount of muscle and intermittent grimacing.  It is more difficult to identify the pattern of generalized paroxysmal fast activity that was noted in her baseline EEG.  The overall pattern is a slow, featureless pattern of delta and theta.\\\\nThere are some sharply contoured activity in the right frontal temporal region.  Despite the muscle and artifact noted in the background, there are occasional triphasic waves observed.\\\\nOver the course of the afternoon, the patient receives Ativan, particularly after 3:00 p.m.  By this point there is some restless, but not that same clear clinical seizure pattern.  The overall background is markedly slow.  There is a periodic complex noted in the right hemisphere, including central temporal region, and triphasic waves are observed.  The patient is placed on an Ativan drip.  No additional clinical seizures are noted.  The EEG remains very slow.\\\\nAs the night continues, there is more of a burst suppression pattern.  There is a featureless pattern with a burst suppression pattern and intermittent theta.  The previously described, periodic sharp waves noted primarily in the right disappear and the periods of suppression are quite prominent in the overnight recording and a little bit more subtle at the 11:00 a.m. recording.\\\\nBy the morning of February 23, 2012 tactile stimulation does not activate the record.\\\\nHR:    120 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This LTM EEG monitoring was remarkable for:\\\\nAn initial pattern which was technically challenging, but with a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.\\\\nThe disappearance of well defined generalized paroxysmal fast activity.\\\\nTriphasic waves.\\\\nPeriodic sharp waves primarily in the right hemisphere.\\\\nUltimately a more of a diffusely slow and discontinuous pattern.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  The use of the benzodiazepine may play a role in the background slowing, but given the comorbidities of this patient\\'s medical issues, a more severe systemic or cerebral process must also be considered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed. The patient had a seizures during the EEG.  She was very confused and as a result, she was sent to the clinic for further evaluation.  By discharge from the clinic, her mental status had returned to baseline.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  The alpha rhythm is vigorous at 40 mV, but the overall background is relatively low voltage.  At higher sensitivities, an asymmetry between the right and left temporal regions can be seen and there is lower voltage, 3-6 Hz activity in the left temporal region, mostly lower voltage delta.  Breach rhythm is noted with accentuation of fast activity at C4.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm.\\\\nHyperventilation produces an increase in the alpha rhythm and an overall increase in amplitude.  As the patient drifts into sleep, more rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity is picked up at T2-C4.  Again, this is all relatively low voltage record.  There are brief vertex waves which are asymmetric and spindles are also heightened a bit on the right.  POSTs are noted in stage 2 sleep.  The breach rhythm is relatively prominent in sleep, but there are no sharp waves or spikes noted.\\\\nDuring photic stimulation, the patient has a complex partial seizure.  This seizure begins at 11:24:19.  The patient opens her eyes and looks to the right.  She is confused.  She moves around and the technologist has difficulty getting her to hold still.  At 12:25:06, she remains confused.  The behavioral aspects of this seizure are quite prolonged.  The EEG aspects are very challenging, though.  There is muscle artifact noted in the EEG while the patient moves around.  It is difficult to see much in the way of the EEG changes for this individual.  The patient is noted to look to the right, not the left at the beginning of the seizure.  Despite the background issues, at 11:24:53 underneath all of this, the EEG is clearly slow and at 11:25:07, there is very clearly a change in the background EEG with a theta pattern with primarily 5-6 Hz activity and then at 11:26:21, the EEG is interpretable and the EEG remains normal despite the fact that the patient is quite confused.  The patient is monitored throughout the remainder of the EEG, which is 26 minutes in duration.  She is still somewhat confused, but the confusion is improving.  Some focal slowing is seen, but it is quite minor.\\\\nHR:    50-60 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nA complex partial seizure which was not at all localized by this EEG and was associated with at least a brief period with generalized theta.\\\\nFocal slowing in the left hemisphere including central temporal region.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniectomy.

She has a markedly suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity.  However, this is in between much artifact which makes it difficult to make any clear final determinations about electrical activity.  In addition, she has bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with frontal predominant sharp waves and polyspikes that appear to at times increase in rhythmicity to a frequency of about 4-5 Hz and last for about 30-40 seconds.  During these bursts, which are usually symmetric, but at times slightly asymmetric, the patient appears to be clinically shaking and twitching and jerking.

The patient is awake with nurse.  She is communicative and conversant.  This seizure began with frontally predominant 4 to 5 Hz spike in wave discharge and then a pause and then additional spike in wave activity.  The EEG is rapidly obscured by muscle and motion artifact due to the tonic clonic activity.  In the initial 30 seconds of seizure, much of the activity transitions very quickly from clonic to prolonged tonic and then tonic clonic activity starts to emerge at 9:10:12.  This seizure is ending at 09:10:26 and then the patient is poorly responsive without additional motor activity although there is a burst of high amplitude poly spike activity noted.  That activity is relatively symmetric.  The post ictal EEG is markedly slow and suppressed.  A slow, delta pattern was noted with eye movement artifacts but without definitive spikes.

There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.\\\\nABNORMAL DISCHARGES:\\\\nFocal sharp waves were seen frequently in sleep and occasionally in wakefulness at F8/T2 much more frequently than F7/T3.\\\\nFocal slowing was seen intermittently and at times very rhythmically at F8/T2 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  At times there was also seen at F7/T3.\\\\nSEIZURES:  The first complex partial seizure occurred at 11:35 a.m.  Electrographically there appeared to be an onset with rhythmic sharp waves noted at T2 in the theta frequency that increased in amplitude and became more rhythmic as well as increasing frequency spreading throughout the right hemisphere. In about 7 seconds spread to the left temporal lobe followed by the hemisphere then slowly becoming slower in frequency into the delta range and finally being obscured by muscle artifact.  After the event there appears to be diffuse slowing throughout the recording.\\\\nClinically, the patient remains asleep during the entirety of the electrographic seizure but once the electrographic seizure ends, he gets up and starts fumbling with the sheets and stands up and starts fumbling with the cables.  At one point he presses the alarm and when the nurse comes he does not realize that he had pressed the button.  It is not clear if he was aware of any of the events and he was not formally tested at that moment.\\\\nComplex partial seizure number 2 occurred at 12:13:32 a.m.  Again, occurs while the patient is asleep.  The EEG reveals a rhythmic T2 sharp wave discharge that increases in amplitude and in frequency to the theta range and becomes more rhythmic as it spreads through the right hemisphere.  About 8 seconds later it starts to spread to the left anterior temporal region out of F7/T3 and then continues to spread to the rest of the hemisphere and seconds later it is obscured by muscle artifact.  The entire seizure lasts 54 seconds.  After the electrographic seizure there is diffuse slowing seen throughout the entire EEG.\\\\nClinically the patient appears to be asleep throughout the electrographic seizures, however, about 6 seconds after the electrographic seizure ends, he wakes, gets up from the bed, and sits up on all 4 extremities, fumbles, and looks around, and jerks back and forth and at times side to side.  About 4 or 5\\\\nminutes later he gets out of bed and starts pulling on the cables.  Finally he removes all the cables from his head.  The RN notices this about 10 minutes later and comes into the room where he appears to not remember what happened and thinks that he was just going to the bathroom.  He was not clinically tested either at this point.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 2 right anterior temporal seizures in addition to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves seen slightly more prominent on the right anterior temporal region than the left mainly in sleep.\\\\nHEART RATE:  84.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal lobe.

The patient had one of her typical spells during the EEG.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta activity noted.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Posts are noted as the patient transitions into sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  It also elicits a behavioral event at 3 Hz, after the driving response with the patient shaking her head back and forth.  This is followed by total body rocking. There are no EEG changes associated with this behavior.  She actually starts shaking well before the events marked by the tech and when her body movements are mild, there is no EEG change. The technologist ends the event by pinching the patient.  Surprisingly, this stops the event.  The technologist stopped the photic stimulation to attend to the patient when the event began.  Total duration was 2 minutes.

       " 'b\"CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old right handed male with epilepsy\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Depakote.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had a seizure during the EEG and removed all of the electrodes which were difficult to replace in the immediate postictal period.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz, 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. Brief drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of background theta.  In the initial sections of the EEG the patient demonstrates bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-6 Hz spike and wave activity of 1 to 3 seconds duration.  When testing can be performed during the bursts, initially the patient is able to repeat after a 3 second burst, but in later sections during hyperventilation with a 5 second burst he does not recall a code word.  The bursts are high amplitude symmetric spike and wave complexes with an after going slow wave.  Hyperventilation was stopped at 3:34:27, 168 seconds into the initiation, simply because the patient stopped hyperventilating and then he was reminded to hyperventilate again at 3:34:35.  During hyperventilation there was clear accentuation of spike and wave activity.  In addition, after a burst of spike and wave activity, there was rhythmic 4-5 Hz activity which was a bit more prominent on the right compared to the left.  This was followed again by a generalized spike and wave discharge.  Brief spike and wave discharges were not associated with impairment of awareness, but those that were 3 to 5 seconds in duration were associated with impairment of duration.\\\\nHyperventilation was initiated at 3:31:43 which clearly accentuated the generalized spike and wave activity.  Increasing bursts of spike and wave activity were observed with increasing duration.\\\\nSEIZURE:  3:32:03  the patient demonstrates increasing bursts of spike and wave activity.  At 3:32:47 he is unable to repeat a phrase.  The EEG returns to normal after 5 seconds.\\\\nAt 3:33:51 the patient demonstrates a brief spike and wave discharge.\\\\nAt 3:35:14 there is a spike and wave discharge which ends with background theta and then a second at 3:35:24, but after that discharge there seems to be more rhythmic theta out of the right hemisphere for a few seconds, then a spike and wave discharge, and then a subtle asymmetry with the appearance of more theta out of the right hemisphere compared to the left.  The patient is behaviorally motionless, but he has stopped hyperventilating and appears to be poorly responsive, although no involuntary movements are noted.  For 20 seconds, the patient demonstrates no positive motor activity, but high amplitude, spike and wave activity is noted in a background with prominent disruption of faster frequency activity and prominent, background delta.\\\\nThe EEG transforms at 03:36:02 with the appearance of 9-16 Hz fast activity.  Behaviorally the patient transitions to a tonoclonic seizure with extension of both hands and then tonic and then clonic activity.  His head turns to the left initially and then as his activity switches to more of a clonic component he moves over to the left and nearly falls out of the chair.  As he does so, his EEG electrodes become loose.  The last seconds of the EEG demonstrated a pattern of fast activity both 9 Hz activity and some beta.\\\\nThe clonic activity is seen at 03:36:13 and the seizure is over at 03:37:00 for a seizure that was approximately 1.5 minutes.  The patient demonstrated prolonged postictal changes.\\\\nHR:    60 to 90 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This EEG is diagnostic of epilepsy with what appeared to be a generalized seizure and generalized spike and wave activity.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The majority of the features noted in this EEG is suggesting generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, as the EEG transitioned from interictal phenomenon with spike and wave activity to the clinical seizure with motion arrest, there was some focality with rhythmic theta observed out of the right hemisphere.  This may suggest more than one contributed to the pathogenesis of this patient\\'s epilepsy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",
       " 'b\"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old male with a past history of Lyme disease, thrombocytopenia, small subdural hematoma and pituitary adenoma.  The patient presented with visual hallucinations, which included seeing well-formed hallucinations such as elephants, lasting many minutes and then more poorly formed visual distortions lasting a brief period of time.  The patient reported no impairment of awareness during the visual phenomena, but did feel anxious the spells.\\\\n\\\\nDATES OF STUDY:  September 22-23.\\\\n\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, others\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient did not initially understand that he was to push the button for his clinical symptoms.  He was able to provide excellent history.  When the data was reviewed with him, he did indicate that he had well-formed visual hallucinations at 8 p.m. on the evening of Saturday, the 22nd, and then the visual distortions described above.  He did not understand that he was to have utilized the seizure pushbutton until the morning of the 23rd.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As this long-term monitor begins, there is an intermittent asymmetry with intermittent disruptions of alpha rhythm on the right compared to the left as well as intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm.\\\\n\\\\nOf note, nurses did confirm with the patient how to use the pushbutton at 1:19 on the 22nd.\\\\n\\\\nSeizure:  Time:  7:43.  The patient is chewing near the onset of the seizure.  This is a prolonged epileptiform discharge initially really only at T6/O2.  By 7:51, it seems to have spread an is a little bit more prominent bilaterally.  There is bit more of an occipital field picked up on the left and there is no well-defined alpha noted on the left.  The nurses comes to check on the patient and fix the electrodes at 8:11.\\\\n\\\\nThe nurse spends a great deal of time with the patient and they have a long conversation.  The patient continues to have an electrographic seizure which waxes and wanes in terms of its spread in the right occipital region with spike and wave activity.  It may be T6 or O2 maximum.\\\\n\\\\nAfter she leaves at 8:27, there is a bit more bilateral representation.  The seizure starts to slow down at 8:46, then waxes and wanes, recurring at 8:51.  It stops at 9:03.  The patient did not recall additional seizures after that episode.  Subsequently, he did disclose that he did recall the event and was aware that he had well-formed visual hallucinations of seeing a horse.\\\\n\\\\nThere is a 2nd seizure at 9:46, significantly briefer.  A 3rd seizure is noted at 10:28, again a brief discharge from the right occipital region.\\\\n\\\\nIn the overnight recording, on 09/22-09/23 the patient has many seizures.  When confronted, he did recall that he had the seizures, but did not report them to the nurses.  He has an approximately 30-minute discharge at 8 p.m. which is a right posterotemporal occipital discharge.  He is tested by the nurse who is not aware of the seizure.  The nurse checks the electrodes during the EEG.  She and the patient have a long conversation, the patient answers questions appropriately and does not appear to have disclosed the seizure to her.\\\\n\\\\nThe patient is up very late at night.  Subsequently, he has multiple brief seizures at 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11:04, 12:03, 12:56, 1:21 a.m., 1:37 a.m.  An additional seizure at 1:59 a.m. is also noted which is slightly different and will be mentioned separately, 2:25 a.m.  He is drifting off to sleep after this.\\\\n\\\\nThe seizures are all about 2-3 minutes in duration and are characterized by spike activity in the right occipital region.  There is some volume conductions to the left occipital region.  When the patient drifts off to sleep, the seizures seem to stop.\\\\n\\\\nThe seizure at 1:59 is remarkable for more of a pattern of rhythmic theta than the spike and wave activity.  As the patient is drifting off to sleep at 2:49, he has another seizure, seems to arouse, but then drifts into stage 2 sleep.  Another seizure is noted at 3:10.  By this point, the patient seems to have transitioned from a pattern of 1 seizure per hour with the onset at 8 p.m. to about 1every 1/2 hour or so.\\\\n\\\\nSpontaneous arousals from sleep are noted at 4 a.m. and there are sections of the record when the patient is awake at 4 a.m. with a well-defined, symmetric background and then a seizure at 4:02.  The seizure and spike detection program picks up a seizure at 5:49 and 6:54.\\\\n\\\\nOn the morning of the 23rd, the nurse discusses with the patient the seizures that he is experiencing.  He describes them as brief visual distortions.  The subsequent seizures are brief, typically 2-3 minutes with a very focal epileptiform discharge in the right posterior quadrant.  The patient describes these seizures as being associated with a visual distortion.\\\\n\\\\nThe RN and MD were present in the unit with the patient, the patient still requires reminders to push the button.  He does volunteer verbally after much reinforcement that he is having a seizure, but still forgets to push the button with his seizures.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional recurrent discharges are noted at 10:54:50.  The patient receives 5 mg of oral Valium.  Around this time, he also receives 1000 mg of levetiracetam.  An additional seizure is noted at 11:11 a.m.  Repeat seizure is noted at 11:34 a.m.  Another seizure is noted at 11:50.\\\\n\\\\nThe house officer initiates phenytoin around this time.  A seizure is noted at 12:05, again the same brief discharge in the right occipital region.  There is a small increase in beta.\\\\n\\\\nAnother seizure is noted at 12:26 and a repeat seizure at 12:43, again with the same characteristics.\\\\n\\\\nAs the patient becomes drowsy, there is an asymmetry of dropout of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.  As the patient starts to drift off to sleep at 1:27 p.m., the seizures seem to improve.\\\\n\\\\nHeart rate 84 BPM.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the long term monitoring unit.  This section of the record includes September 23 and September 24, 2012.  The patient had multiple seizures on the night of September 23, 2012, slowing to infrequent seizures on the morning of September 24, 2012.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In much of the waking background, the activity is symmetric, well defined alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.\\\\n\\\\nIntermittent complex partial seizures or simple partial seizures are noted from the right occipital region on the night of September 23, 2012.  The patient receives additional phenytoin and valium.  There is hiatus between 3:00 a.m. and 3:52 a.m. with simple partial seizure characterized by repetitive ictal activity and the next seizure at 8:37 a.m.\\\\n\\\\nAs the record continues on September 24, 2012, additional sleep is recorded during the day with vertex waves and an increase in beta.  There is an intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.\\\\n\\\\nHeart rate:  60 BPM.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONTINUATION\\\\n\\\\nA 61-year-old male with Lyme disease, pituitary adenoma and right subdural hematoma, now with recurrent hallucinations.\\\\n\\\\nSeptember 23rd:  During this section of the record, the patient is aware of seizures in the early parts of the recording.  A seizure was noted at 1:29 p.m. on the 23rd.  After this, the patient is sleeping and in sleep, there is subtle focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant.  Consistently, the patient does not seem to seize during sleep.\\\\n\\\\nSeizure was noted by the patient at 2:03:24, his typical 2-minute seizure.  The next seizure is at 2:54 p.m.  Seizure identical to previously described seizures was noted at 3:19 and another one at 3:35.  The next seizure is at 4:38:59, again lasting 2-3 minutes.  After this, the patient is awake with a well-defined alpha.  Another seizure was noted at 4:43 and at 4:46.  Again, seizure was noted at 5:10 p.m. and then at 5:47.  At this time, the patient  is very good about identifying his seizures.  He does not have another seizure until 7:51 and then another one at 8:15 p.m.\\\\n\\\\nBy 8:16, the EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern.  By 8:28, the patient is falling asleep and is in stage 2 sleep.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This last section on the 24th includes a significant amount of sleep.\\\\n\\\\nBy this section in the record, the patient had learned to push the button for all seizures.  No seizures were recorded in the final hours of the EEG recording, but occasional subtle right occipital spikes or sharp waves were noted.  As the recording continued, the intermittent alpha asymmetry resolves.  There were some bursts of posterior temporal theta, but none with the frequency evolution noted with the well-defined seizures.\\\\n\\\\nThere was one more subtle discharge noted at 3:10 p.m. with very subtle spiking in the right occipital region.  This was one of the patient\\'s typical 3-minute seizures.  A final brief seizure was recorded at 6:17 p.m. on the 24th.\\\\n\\\\nHeart rate 120 bpm.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:\\\\n1. A pattern of intermittent seizures, quite prominent on the morning of the 23rd, out of the right occipital region.\\\\n2. Intermittent right occipital slowing.\\\\n3. Intermittent right occipital disruption of the alpha rhythm.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This epileptiform pattern is congruent with this patient\\'s imaging and supports a focal mechanism for seizures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",
       " \"b'REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.\\\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, chromosome 17 deletion, neutropenia, and seizures described as generalized tonic-clonic and eye fluttering.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Tegretol, Valium, Seroquel, melatonin.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures only included photic stimulation.\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was a lot of continuous movement artifact throughout the recording and an A2 electrode continuous artifact.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely disorganized background with no abnormal posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a diffuse beta seen throughout the recording.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures, which only included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.\\\\nAbnormal discharges:\\\\nAnterior predominant spike and wave bursts seen at a frequency of 2 to 2.5 Hz intermittently throughout the recording.\\\\nDiffuse slowing at 2 to 4 Hz seen throughout the recording intermixed with diffuse beta.\\\\nThere is arrhythmic CZ discharge seen continuously throughout the recording which at times has a benign morphology and at times becomes more sharply contoured.  It appears to be of higher amplitude than the background frequencies and it dies not appear to become rhythmic at any point.  This pattern is of unclear significance.\\\\nSeizures:  None.\\\\nHeart rate:  84.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing intermixed with diffuse beta in addition to slow anterior predominant generalized spike and wave and central discharge of unclear significance.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy and supports the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  There is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, there is a central discharge which appears to be of unclear significance, but likely benign in nature.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",
       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old male, status epilepticus on August  4, 2012, ESRD, with a  2 to 3 year history of epilepsy.  The patient has a history of multiple head traumas.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax, Phenobarbital\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  No clinical seizures were reported by the team during this section of the record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  The patient is often quite drowsy, but there is a glimpse of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally, left more so than right.  Breach rhythm was noted in the right hemisphere with accentuation of beta in that region as well as some right central delta.  As the recording continues, the patient is more consistently awake.  He is awake in the middle of the night with a rapid heart rate of 120 bpm and frequent PVCs.\\\\nSeizure time 3:28 a.m.  This develops after the tachycardia.  The nurse enters to check on the patient with the tachycardia, and then the rhythmic theta builds up at 3:28:45.  The nurse does not appear to have identified any clinical seizures in association with the rapid heart rate, although she is looking at a monitor, away from the patient, not at the patient.  There are a total of 3 seizures noted in this section of the record on August 5 through August 6.  These include 3:32 a.m. on August 6, 8:02 a.m. on August 6, and 8:13 am.  The nurse is with the patient at 8:02.  The patient is responsive during the seizure but cannot talk and seems to be indicating that he feels tremulous.   A fourth seizure occurs at 8:45 a.m., with the patient watching television.  Cognitive testing is performed and he has some what seem to be purposeful movements of his lower extremities.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring for this patient with a complex partial status epilepticus was remarkable for significant improvement over the course of 48 hour video EEG monitoring, but he still continued to demonstrate brief left frontal seizures which seemed to produce a feeling of tremulousness and speech arrest with relatively preserved cognition.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related epilepsy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The child is in a wheelchair and supported. He is not able to cooperate with testing.  Photic stimulation was completed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The normal morphologies in wakefulness are not identified.  There is a background of mixed frequency activity with theta and delta.  The technologist struggles with electrode integrity during this EEG.\\\\nInitially, there are prominent sharp waves and spikes noted at the midline including FZ and CZ.  Some of these, in a transverse montage start very close to the midline on the left.  Using referential or other montages, they seem to start at FZ or CZ and then transition to the right and in bipolar montages, there is much more of a field in the right frontocentral region.\\\\nAs the tech continues trying to fix the electrodes, the patient may have well had an electrographic seizure with buildup of epileptiform activity in the right frontocentral region which differs from the initial pattern.  During this relatively prolonged discharge while the technologist is working with the patient, no clinical changes are noted.  The patient is sitting in a wheelchair, reclining with both hands in a cortical posture.\\\\nThe seizure seems to be waning at 12:12 when the technologist starts photic stimulation.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\\\nOctober 6-7\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:\\\\nAs the tracing began, there was a great deal of muscle artifact in the EEG.  In addition to the eye blink artifact, there is a periodic complex identified in the frontocentral regions with a broad field of spread in the parasagittal regions.  When reviewed with an a CZ reference, CZ appears to be active.  There are frontal, periodic, discrete sharp waves or spikes noted.\\\\nThroughout the recording, a Versed drip is initiated.  The Versed drip is initiated at 11:29.  At 11:48, the patient receives 4 mg bolus of Versed which significantly decreased both periodic complexes and the background artifact.  When the sensitivity is increased, the sharp wave can be much more easily defined and is a CZ vertex sharp.  The periodicity of the sharp wave is approximately 1 per second and varies from 0.5 per second to 1 per second.  There is no frequency evolution associated with this discharge.\\\\nHeart rate 93 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nA challenging but slow background noted prior to the Versed bolus.\\\\nA periodic or pseudoperiodic complex noted in the background sometimes with a frontal sharp wave, sometimes with a vertex sharp wave.\\\\nAbsence of significant reactivity to tactile stimulation.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above can be seen in the context of anoxic encephalopathy.  It can also be seen as a late status epilepticus pattern.  In this\\\\nindividual with a past history of epilepsy and a recent anoxic insult, additional EEG monitoring was initiated to clarify this finding\\\\nOctober 7-8\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:\\\\nThis section of the record demonstrates primarily a theta background.  Some sections of the record demonstrate significantly more muscle.  There is an underlying vertex sharp wave more apparent in some sections than others.  This sharp wave does not demonstrate frequency evolution.  The background does have some variability in that some sections including at 2:00 a.m. have a bit more continuous theta but at 6:00 a.m. there is more of a pattern of theta and then discontinuity.  On some occasions, tactile stimulation of the patient produced artifact but tactile stimulation of the patient did not produce an alerting response in the EEG.\\\\nThe clinical team noted that after the Versed drip was increased, the patient\\'s eye blinking stopped.  No other involuntary movements were noted, and even though there were some sections of the record with some muscle artifact, when the patient receives nursing care, there is no change in EEG.\\\\nBy the end of the first 24 hours, the EEG is relatively continuous with brief attenuations but demonstrates frontal or vertex sharp waves.  At that juncture, the Versed drip is increased from 5 to 5.5 mg.\\\\nOctober 7 through October 8, continuous video EEG monitoring:  Medications Depakote, Versed, others.  Introduction:  Continuous video EEG monitoring during this section of the recording is provided for a comatose, intubated woman without motor activity.  The EEG demonstrates an overall low voltage mixed theta with smaller amounts of delta pattern.  There is a subtle and prominent sharp wave noted in the frontocentral regions.  This is almost a vertex sharp wave, but in this section of the record the phase reversal is starting to shift just to the right of the midline; however, using an average reference this is now transitioned from a CZ sharp wave to an FV sharp wave with just a bit more spread to F4.\\\\nIn the overnight hours, the patient seems to have been dazed at around 3:00 a.m., producing a great deal of muscle.\\\\nIn the overnight recording, the frontal sharp wave seems to be fading.  The overall quality of the EEG starts to vary a bit, although there is no note as to whether or not the electrodes had been moved.\\\\nBy 4:30 a.m., the FV sharp wave is noted, and at this point it is a bit more prominent at F3 than F4.  The sharp wave is becoming less continuous, seen about once every second by 5:30 a.m.  At 6:03 a.m., tactile stimulation of the patient does not seem to activate the record.  The sharp wave does not evolve.  No note is made as to whether or not there has been additional changes in the patient\\'s medications, but the background EEG which accompanies the sharp wave include a little less theta and a bit more arrhythmic delta with intermittent attenuations.\\\\nEKG:  NA.\\\\nINTERVAL IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring for this patient with an anoxic insult and post-anoxic ocular jerking demonstrates a pattern of fading periodic complexes.  These complexes have a complex feel of spread, maximum at the midline at CZ and then transitioning to FV.  By the end of the 2-day recording, the activity appeared to be less epileptiform in nature and the overall periodicity was fading.\\\\nNo evolving seizures were identified.\\\\nOctober 8-9\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.  No involuntary eye twitching was noted, but sometimes the patient was observed to have stiffening of the jaw.

Many others.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:\\\\nAs the tracing began, there was a great deal of muscle artifact in the EEG.  In addition to the eye blink artifact, there is a periodic complex identified in the frontocentral regions with a broad field of spread in the parasagittal regions.  When reviewed with an a CZ reference, CZ appears to be active.  There are frontal, periodic, discrete sharp waves or spikes noted.\\\\nThroughout the recording, a Versed drip is initiated.  The Versed drip is initiated at 11:29.  At 11:48, the patient receives 4 mg bolus of Versed which significantly decreased both periodic complexes and the background artifact.  When the sensitivity is increased, the sharp wave can be much more easily defined and is a CZ vertex sharp.  The periodicity of the sharp wave is approximately 1 per second and varies from 0.5 per second to 1 per second.  There is no frequency evolution associated with this discharge.\\\\nHeart rate 93 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nA challenging but slow background noted prior to the Versed bolus.\\\\nA periodic or pseudoperiodic complex noted in the background sometimes with a frontal sharp wave, sometimes with a vertex sharp wave.\\\\nAbsence of significant reactivity to tactile stimulation.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above can be seen in the context of anoxic encephalopathy.  It can also be seen as a late status epilepticus pattern.  In this\\\\nindividual with a past history of epilepsy and a recent anoxic insult, additional EEG monitoring was initiated to clarify this finding.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:\\\\nThis section of the record demonstrates primarily a theta background.  Some sections of the record demonstrate significantly more muscle.  There is an underlying vertex sharp wave more apparent in some sections than others.  This sharp wave does not demonstrate frequency evolution.  The background does have some variability in that some sections including at 2:00 a.m. have a bit more continuous theta but at 6:00 a.m. there is more of a pattern of theta and then discontinuity.  On some occasions, tactile stimulation of the patient produced artifact but tactile stimulation of the patient did not produce an alerting response in the EEG.\\\\nThe clinical team noted that after the Versed drip was increased, the patient\\'s eye blinking stopped.  No other involuntary movements were noted, and even though there were some sections of the record with some muscle artifact, when the patient receives nursing care, there is no change in EEG.\\\\nBy the end of the first 24 hours, the EEG is relatively continuous with brief attenuations but demonstrates frontal or vertex sharp waves.

Introduction:  Continuous video EEG monitoring during this section of the recording is provided for a comatose, intubated woman without motor activity.  The EEG demonstrates an overall low voltage mixed theta with smaller amounts of delta pattern.  There is a subtle and prominent sharp wave noted in the frontocentral regions.  This is almost a vertex sharp wave, but in this section of the record the phase reversal is starting to shift just to the right of the midline; however, using an average reference this is now transitioned from a CZ sharp wave to an FV sharp wave with just a bit more spread to F4.\\\\nIn the overnight hours, the patient seems to have been dazed at around 3:00 a.m., producing a great deal of muscle.\\\\nIn the overnight recording, the frontal sharp wave seems to be fading.  The overall quality of the EEG starts to vary a bit, although there is no note as to whether or not the electrodes had been moved.\\\\nBy 4:30 a.m., the FV sharp wave is noted, and at this point it is a bit more prominent at F3 than F4.  The sharp wave is becoming less continuous, seen about once every second by 5:30 a.m.  At 6:03 a.m., tactile stimulation of the patient does not seem to activate the record.  The sharp wave does not evolve.  No note is made as to whether or not there has been additional changes in the patient\\'s medications, but the background EEG which accompanies the sharp wave include a little less theta and a bit more arrhythmic delta with intermittent attenuations.\\\\nEKG:  NA.\\\\nINTERVAL IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring for this patient with an anoxic insult and post-anoxic ocular jerking demonstrates a pattern of fading periodic complexes.

The system employed continuous seizure and spike detection.  Clinical push button detections were performed by the staff for clinical events.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, there are sharp waves noted particularly at C3, more so than P3.  Seizures waxed and waned.\\\\nAt 12:48 the seizures stopped briefly and alpha frequency activity seen from the right.  They then recur with sharp waves and spikes at 12:49.\\\\nAs benzodiazepines were employed, intermittently, there are brief suppressions and attenuations noted.\\\\nThere is variability in terms of the epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere which can be central, central parietal, or posterior with almost a polyspike component in the left occipital region.

The record demonstrates intermittent improvement in this 24 hour section with improvement of the background bilaterally, but persistent left central parietal epileptiform activity with fast activity in the parietal occipital region.  The patient receives increasing doses of phenobarbital.  This produces an increase in the discontinuous pattern, but the complex epileptiform activity in the left occipital parietal region persists.

The patient was observed to have continuous eye blink throughout hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of rhythmic theta with some rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness noted from the left or right temporal region.  Other features of drowsiness include some hypersynchronous rhythmic high-amplitude theta.  Photic stimulation was completed at the end of the study.  Although there is a photic driving response, there is some subtle theta more apparent in the left hemisphere.  Some of this is also sharply contoured.  On one occasion, at 21 Hz, there is some higher amplitude rhythmic delta, but unfortunately also some eye blink artifact.\\\\nHeart rate 84 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a challenging EEG, but is abnormal due to a subtle focality noted late in the record with a bit more irregular theta noted on the left.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were observed.

In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9 to 9.5 Hz to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically. Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts.  Heart rate was 80-85 beats per minute.  The patient had 2 episodes when her right arm started jerking for less than a minute without any ictal change in the EEG except for muscle artifact.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background in theta activity seen during wakefulness.

The right hemisphere is nearly normal with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a pattern with generous beta.  The left hemisphere has a continuous, periodic complete with a generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere, but maximum in the left mid to posterior temporal region.  This also has significant involvement in the left parietal and occipital region.  Using an average reference, this activity is nearly maximum at O1 with a phase reversal at P3.  The phase reverses at P3-C3.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta is noted throughout the right hemisphere, less so on the left.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Heart rate is 72 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nA complex, epileptiform discharge in the left hemisphere with some variability and even a polyphasic component.  This discharge may begin in the left frontocentral region, but its highest amplitude is in the left occipital region with a generous field of spread in the left posterior quadrant.\\\\nThis is essentially a periodic complex without frequency evolution.\\\\nDisruption faster frequency activity from the left hemisphere.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The periodic complexes in the left hemisphere are similar to previous EEG, including previous EEG monitoring.

There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is consistent of diffuse delta slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is also some burst suppression seen intermittently.  Superimposed over this background are rhythmic low amplitude of what appears to be polyspikes which at times appear to have a left frontal predominance and sometimes right frontal predominance, and at times they are seen diffusely followed by a beta discharge.  During everyone of these discharges the patient has a jerk which moves her head towards the left and at times towards the right.

       " 'b\"TIME OF RECORDING:  11:20\\\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old male with epilepsy since age 16 admitted with 5 generalized tonic clonic seizures on January 17, 2013 after he ran out of Depakote for 2 months.  The patient had a seizure at 9:55 this morning lasting 15-20 minutes.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Depakote, midazolam, Truvada, Reyataz.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was drowsy.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern with generous beta and eye rolling artifact, generous 16 and 17 Hz beta is noted in the background.  Arousals produce a small amount of 4.5 Hz theta activity bilaterally, 17 Hz spindle like activity is noted in the background\\\\nAt the end of the record the patient is awakening a bit and there is some 12 Hz activity noted in the background.\\\\nHeart rate:  84 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for excess beta.\\\\nNo epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta in a drowsy patient after a tonic clonic seizure maybe due to the use of benzodiazepines.  To more completely characterize this patient\\'s epilepsy, a follow up study when the patient is able to come to the lab is suggested.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

The patient is recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.\\\\n\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall the background is consistent of delta frequency slowing, which is seen maximal over the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere reveals rhythmic sharp waves and intermittent suppression, which I will discuss, and abnormal discharges.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.\\\\n\\\\nABNORMAL DISCHARGES:\\\\n1. Focal sharp waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere at a frequency in a periodic manner occurring at 1 Hz, maximal at F74/T3, consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED\\'s).  In between these PLED\\'s there is suppression of faster frequencies over that hemisphere.\\\\n2. Focal slowing seen continuously over the right hemisphere at F84/T4, seen throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-5 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.\\\\n\\\\nSEIZURES:  Throughout the recording there are frequent recurrent seizures arising from the right hemisphere, appearing to be maximal at T4, starting with a beta frequency discharge that appears to slow down in frequency, increase in amplitude and spread to the right hemisphere.  It appears to remain mainly over the right hemisphere and slowly subside afterwards, leaving some postictal focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.  These discharges have no clinical correlate and are consistent with nonconvulsive seizures or electrographic seizures.  They are occurring frequently, multiple times throughout the recording and last from 30 second to 1 minute.\\\\n\\\\nHEART RATE:  108.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to recurring right midtemporal electrographic seizure in relation to left anterior temporal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrographic nonconvulsive status epilepticus arising from the right midtemporal region.  In addition, there is focal cerebral dysfunction in that region, which may signify a structural lesion or focal irritability in that region.  In addition, there is independent focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the left anterior temporal region, which may also signify another focus of structural dysfunction and irritability.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

       " 'b\"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old male with frequent daily seizures, difficulty walking, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, vagal nerve stimulator.\\\\n\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Keppra, Trileptal, Klonopin, Phenobarbital, and others.\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside and the EEG monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The mother noted 1 seizure on the morning of the 22nd characterized by a subtle head drop.  She did not push the button and this behavior is difficult to discern from the patient\\'s baseline.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal with a somewhat slow background and a suggestion of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm seen on occasion.  The overall background is quite variable.  Some sections are richer in beta than others.  Some sections demonstrate high amplitudes, both spike and wave activity typically occurring in birth, others demonstrate lower voltage, more subtle sharp waves.\\\\n\\\\nA practice push button was noted at 9:47 when the patient was with the mother and the nurse.  This is one of the few sections of the record devoid of epileptiform activity.\\\\n\\\\nThe sleep record demonstrates a relatively slow featureless pattern with high amplitude spike and wave activity mostly from the left hemisphere but also sometimes at T4 or C4.  There are some morphologies suggestive of normal sleep including spindles.\\\\n\\\\nAt 8:20 in the morning, there was a burst of high amplitude delta with some polyspike activity.  This does not have a strong epileptiform appearance of some of the other discharges but may correlate with the head dropping discharge that the mother described.  It does, however, look more like a transition to drowsiness in that the patient seems to be drifting off to sleep, both before and after.  There is another burst at 8:31 while he is eating with a burst of slow spike and wave activity lasting 3 seconds.  It is not clear if this is the clinical event that the mother noted.\\\\n\\\\nHeart rate 96 beats per minute.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

Vagal nerve stimulator.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Trileptal, phenobarbital, clonazepam and others.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the EEG monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The mother reports that the patient had no clinical seizure during this section of the record although she would site that the clinical events on the morning of the 22nd were at 0830 although she forgot to push the button. The mother was provided with a paper log to document seizures and the nurses continued their usual documentation, again, not identifying any seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Abundant sections of this EEG demonstrate a low voltage pattern with a suggestion of an alpha rhythm and generous response to central beta. Slow spike and wave is noted with a bilateral representation, but appeared to be maximum on the left. There are occasional focal sharp waves or high amplitude spikes with various localizations in the left hemisphere, frontocentral or mid temporal. There are a handful of sharp waves noted from the right. Occasional rhythmic 5 Hz of TIRDA is noted from the left anterior temporal region.\\\\nIn drowsiness, there is TIRDA maximum T1 nearly, so electric at T1 and T3. There are complex spikes some of which start with a lower voltage spike at T7 and more than higher amplitude anterior F7, FP1 spike. There are sections of the record with stage II sleep with relatively extensive areas which are free of epileptiform activity.\\\\nUsing a referential montage, some of the epileptiform activity is poly spike at T3, A1 and the epileptiform activity has a relatively generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere.\\\\nHeart rate is 84 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This long term video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:\\\\nMarkedly abnormal background with improvement with medication reduction .\\\\nMany epileptiform discharges with many different patterns, some but not all of which, localized to the left hemisphere including some spike and wave, focal spike and way and poly spikes.\\\\nA more subtle sharp wave is noted on the right.\\\\nWhat was likely a clinical seizure on the morning of the 22nd characterized by\\\\nhead dropping.\\\\nAnother subclinical seizure time February 23rd, 0722:55. The patient is talking to his mother. He is moving about. He looks to the right. The mother does not notice any clinical signs. He turns to the right and snores briefly. The seizure begins at 0722:56 and is characterized by the appearance of rhythmic 7 Hz activity which demonstrates frequency evolution and is over at 0723:18 with characteristic postictal slowing noted in the EEG.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  Two seizures, one is the seizure described by the mother with head dropping and two, the seizure with head turning to the right and a bit of snoring. The second seizure is similar to the seizure described in this patient\\'s previous EEG monitoring session  in Puerto Rico although that one was described as left hemispheric fast activity. This seizure is really more of a rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity with clear phase reversal and a temporal lobe localization.\\\\nThe EEG is diagnostic of a localization related epilepsy. Additional EEG recording may be of value to more fully characterize this individual\\'s epilepsy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily of EEG abnormalities and clinical events.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  From 07/02/2013 to 07/03/2013; the interictal posterior dominant rhythm consisted of 9-10 Hz activity that was moderate amount of diffuse beta activity.  Stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and the presence of vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and a sleep and slow waves of stage III were also observed. Hyperventilation was performed at 9:20 A.M. by physician, which led to symmetric slowing of background. Photic stimulation was performed at 10:21 A.M. and was followed by no abnormal response or clinical seizures. (Heart rate was between 60-90 per minute and was regular.)\\\\nClinical events: All her clinical events happened during wakefulness.\\\\nOn 07/03/2013, the patient was sitting at the edge of the bed at 7:40 a.m., was being examined by physician, she reported feeling numbness and tingling in both her hands, she stated that this is one of her typical seizures episodes.  This lasted 2-3 minutes.  At 7:45:21, the patient said she does not feel numbness or tingling any more.  During this episode, the patient was awake and able to answer all questions correctly. The EEG showed an awake pattern with no ictal EEG correlation.\\\\nOn 07/03/2013 at 6 a.m., the patient was lying in bed. The patient was drowsy.  Then, she woke up.  There was no jerking noted, the patient pushed the alarm button at 6:13 a.m.  EEG showed awake state with no epileptic changes.  The nurse came into the room and checked the blood pressure.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  The video EEG monitoring study was normal and did not show electrographic changes consistent with the clinical events.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The interictal EEG does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  A simple partial seizure cannot be ruled out by this recording, although complex partial, generalized tonic clonic, and myoclonic seizures can be ruled out.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  We did not capture all the typical seizure types including the generalized tonic-clonic seizures and further long-term monitoring admissions are recommended for capturing the rest of the events.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

Most seizures occur at night, right arm stiffens and the patient reaches for his left hand, is unable to speak, no definitive loss of consciousness.  Total seizure duration 1 minute.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase of rhythmic theta.  In stage I sleep, there are vertex waves.  Vertex waves seem to be slightly asymmetric with a field that is maximum on the right on some occasions.  There is also a subtle shifting asymmetry noted in the right and left central regions in sleep.\\\\nHyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.\\\\nIn photic stimulation, the patient is drifting in and out of sleep but there seems to be a vertex wave, again somewhat asynchronous and in this case at CZC3 during photic stimulation.\\\\nHeart rate 78 beats per minute.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a somewhat unusual, unlikely abnormal electroencephalogram for an adult of this age due to:  Vertex activity with shifting asymmetry but often with a localization to the right of the midline.\\\\nClinical correlation:  In this young adult with a question of extra temporal epilepsy, the asymmetry described above may reflect either an asymmetry in the appearance of vertex activity or an underlying midline sharp which is under-recognized.  There is a suggestion on only 1 occasion of a sharp wave just to the left of midline.  A follow-up study with additional electrodes would be of value.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses\\' notes were used to review the EEG.\\\\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact in the ear (A,- A2) electrodes halfway through the recording.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm and mainly diffuse beta continuously seen.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall there appears to be an overriding beta and background slowing underneath the diffuse beta.\\\\nAbnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen frequently over F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.\\\\nSeizures:  The patient has recurrent electrographic seizures that appear to have an unclear onset but mainly seem to develop from a beta discharge in the prefrontal region, mainly at FP1, which quickly spreads to the contralateral hemisphere and is obscured by muscle artifact.  Afterward there is diffuse delta that remains slightly more prominently over the left hemisphere until it dissipates.  The average seizure lasts about 2 minutes.  During the first recording, he was having about 5 or 6 seizures per hour.  As the time goes along, it decreases to 5, then 4 seizures per hour.  The last hour that they stopped, from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m., he has about 3 seizures.  After that there are no more seizures seen.  During the seizures, it is hard to clearly see any clear correlation in the video, but there appears to be some muscle artifact seen, noted in the EEG as described above, consistent with an EEG clinical correlate.  After 2:00 a.m., no seizures were seen.  Some burst suppression is noted, but mainly the same background remains.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple recurrent seizures of unclear onset, but possibly left prefrontal region with additional left anterior temporal focal slowing.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures possibly arising from the left prefrontal region, which appears to have stopped by 2:00 a.m.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, the diffuse beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  There is underlying generalized slowing which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.

The patient also had disorganized background activity with excess theta and at times, with a frequency of 5-7 Hz and at times delta activity most pronounced during sleep.  Drowsiness and sleep were characterized by slowing of background activity, and absence of eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Photic stimulation was performed and results in no driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed results in diffuse slowing in the background activity.

This is a 24-hour continuous video EEG recording.  The recording was reviewed on several occasions throughout the 24-hour period.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and high amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of low amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity.  There is anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right hemisphere.  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere and the anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak.  There are continuous semirhythmic and rhythmic moderate amplitude sharp waves with upgoing slow waves observed over the left posterior quadrant, with maximal scalp negativity over T5 and 01 electrodes.  Frequently, these epileptiform discharges are accompanied by low amplitude fast activity.  Frequency of these discharges on average is approximately 1 Hz.  Additionally, they frequently transform into brief poorly organized runs of polymorphic theta and delta with imbedded sharp waves.  This EEG pattern represents ictal interictal continuum.  On several occasions, frank discrete electrographic seizures are  observed.  These start with approximately 1 Hz sharp waves with upgoing slow waves with accompanied fast activity observed over the left posterior quadrant.  This activity increases in frequency into the theta range.  It gradually evolves into approximately 2-1/2 to 3 Hz sharp wave contoured left posterior quadrant delta activity that spreads to the left temporal leads.  These seizures have poorly defined electrographic onset.  They last approximately 60 seconds and in example of such, a seizure occurs at about 6:03 p.m.  As the recording progresses, such seizures become better defined.  These seizures occur several times an hour.  Additionally, as the recording progresses, diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured and periods of discontinuity are noted.  No normal sleep architecture is captured, however, periods of quiescence are noted.  Starting at approximately 8 p.m., there is progressive electrode artifact that eventually affects multiple leads.

Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, possibly related to infarct related and medication effect.  Focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the left posterior quadrant, and epileptiform discharges emanating from the left posterior quadrant indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and consistent with the patient\\'s history of recent left parieto-occipital tumor resection.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  When compared to the recording from the prior 24 hours, the degree of slowing is overall less.

She moves her eyes to the right and turns her head to the right and starts moaning.  Next, her right arm starts shaking back and forth and she continues to do this for some seconds until her shoulders start shaking and then she starts shaking the left arm.  Next, the head moves to the left and then she starts moving side to side while moaning.  At this point the left hand appears to be having some automatisms and she starts arching her back until the seizure ends.\\\\nElectrographically at the onset of the seizure there appeared to be a bilateral prefrontal discharge which only causes the left hemisphere to become attenuated and muscle artifact starts forming.  At that point central alpha discharge is noticed, specifically a CZ, which then involves into a diffuse theta and delta slowing seen in both hemispheres.  As the patient\\'s head moves side to side, the rhythmicity continues to evolve and suddenly stops.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as presence of posts vertex sharp transients, K complexes, and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in diffuse slowing of the background activity intermixed with high amplitude 3 Hz delta activity lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed and resulted in a driving response with no abnormal response.  The patient had 2 episodes of body jerks while awake during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Intermittent body jerks were captured during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  Intermittent body jerks without any ictal change on EEG suggestive of these being probably subcortical in origin.

Now poorly responsive. Elusive neurological diagnosis with possible encephalitis, inflammation, demyelination 0< neoplasm.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Keppra, others.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDS: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside In the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was awake but confused. Electrode locations were modified because of the patients recent biopsy. In addition, it was not possible to achieve adequate impedances at all electrodes due to the patient\\'s fragile skin.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial seconds of the EEG are technically quite challenging with a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. When awake, the patient is answering questions appropriately. When unstimulated, the background EEG is diffusely slow with prominent mixtures of 2 Hz delta and 5 Hz theta. In addition, there is an asymmetry in the theta activity, which is a bit more prominent in the right hemisphere than the left. The frontal delta is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.\\\\nHeart rate 96 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nIMPRESSION:\\\\n1. Marked background slowing.\\\\n2. An asymmetry with disruption of the theta frequency activity on the left compared to the right\\\\n3. Frontally predominant rhythmic delta, right greater than left.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual is awake but confused. She demonstrated some lip smacking behaviors during the EEG, but they did not carry an EEG signature. Because of the concern for subtle underlying seizures, additional EEG long-term recording was requested.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

The sharp waves identified are from the right hemisphere.  There is a generous field of spread and the maximum varies from right mid to posterior temporal.  The anterior temporal sharp waves have perhaps a greater field of spread then the posterior temporal ones.  In sleep, the epileptiform activity is associated with a polyspike or fast component with a generous right central temporal spread.

The patient was relatively drowsy.  This is a somewhat technically challenging EEG with impedances greater than 5 kilohms.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG is markedly slow with primarily a delta theta pattern.  Over time, the patient is increasingly awake with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.\\\\n\\\\nAs the patient becomes awake and alert, she subsequently has a focal seizure out of the left hemisphere with repetitive 6-8 hertz theta frequency activity.  This seizure begins at 1:59 PM and was characterized by facial grimacing and a small amount of head turning from side to side.  When asked to for her name, she is unable to respond.

There is a generous field of spread in the left hemisphere, particularly frontal temporal.  Though the activity is most prominent in the anterior temporal region, within seconds the activity is really throughout the left hemisphere.\\\\n\\\\nThe recording concludes at 2:23.

Fast and slow alpha rhythm is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-\\\\n25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV,\\\\n5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During\\\\ndrowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more\\\\nprominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the\\\\nrecord slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K\\\\ncomplexes appear.  Patient transitions rapidly into drowsiness and sleep.\\\\nNo focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.\\\\nHyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse\\\\nsymmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)\\\\ninduces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.\\\\nSummary of Findings:\\\\nDiffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild\\\\nSleep, stage 2\\\\nAlpha variant, fast\\\\nAlpha variant, slow\\\\nInterpretation:\\\\nThis is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 41-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.

The alpha rhythm is present at 07:06:52 and seizure onset is likely 2 seconds after that for approximate seizure duration 1 minute 19 seconds.  Ictal characteristics include the development of rhythmic repetitive delta than theta and by 07:07:10 sharp waves maximum at T1, followed 4 seconds later by fast activity.  Exquisite, fast activity is picked up at T1 and in the left anterior temporal regions.  The rhythmic repetitive theta activity with superimposed fast activity is noted during the seizure, the operative team is moving about and there is a background beta artifact.  The seizure continues at 07:08:04, but ends abruptly at 07:08:14.  There is a lower voltage fast activity and then 4 seconds of subtle underlying left temporal delta.\\\\nBehavioral Characteristics:  The patient is resting quietly.  Oral automatisms were noted.  There is a great deal of background noise.  Testing was performed at 07:07:44 during the ongoing electrographic seizure, although latent seizure and the patient is able to answer questions appropriately.  The patient was not aware of the seizure.  As the recording continues, the patient is allowed to rest comfortably and the pattern includes awake drowsy record without any additional epileptiform activity.\\\\nHeart rate 78 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nElectrographic left temporal seizure with oral automatisms, limited testing but no impairment of speech but patient not aware of the event.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  This is a new finding for this individual who has had previous EEG studies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

Placed on Depo-Provera 3 weeks ago, but found to be 5 weeks pregnant with abdominal pain and nausea.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Zarontin, lamotrigine, and prenatal vitamins.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory study.  This patient had multiple electrographic discharges with clinical impairment of awareness identified with some. Hyperventilation was deferred.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  The waking background includes generous beta as well as some theta in the occipital regions.  In wakefulness, an occipital spike and slow wave complex was noted of 3-4 hertz.  The spike may be bilateral or more prominent in the right or left occipital region.\\\\nFeatures of drowsiness include an increase in theta.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness with POSTS noted in sleep.\\\\nEpileptiform abnormalities include occipital 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity, which may be unilateral or bilateral.  In this relatively high amplitude record, there is some underlying theta noted.\\\\nSeizures: This patient had between 15 and 18 electrographic discharges, which are 3-5 hertz in nature.  They are generalized with some variability in terms of maxima, some seem to have maximum in the right frontal or occipital regions, other at Pz, and others are more clearly a generalized pattern.  They occur as the patient is drifting off to sleep; early stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Most discharges are either 7-10 seconds or 17-20 seconds duration.  The technologist performs testing.  The technologist attempts to perform testing early on in the discharges, but arouses the patient approximately 5-7 seconds in the discharge and stimulation of the patient does appear to terminate the discharges.  In the longer bursts, the technologist is able to demonstrate that the patient is not aware that she has had an event and the patient stated that she was sleeping even during the events in which she was awake.  Towards the close of the EEG, the events are starting to occur out of stage 2 sleep and then again with auditory stimulation the patient alerts.\\\\nVery limited photic stimulation was completed: a driving response was noted.\\\\nHeart rate 90 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nMultiple bursts of 3-5 hertz spike and wave activity of 7-10 seconds in duration with variable maxima and variable onset. Some are clearly clinical seizures\\\\nRhythmic theta prior to the spike and wave activity.\\\\nOccipital spike and slow wave complexes.\\\\nPosterior theta.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs for comparison.  This EEG suggests a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  There are many atypical features noted in this record and a consideration for an atypical absence or secondary generalized process is appropriate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The patient reports persistent peri-incisional pain with severe headaches, but no seizures.  Left homonymous hemianopia.\\\\nMEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, Keppra, Atarax, Klonopin, Lexapro, retrovirals.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  The patient was uncomfortable, drowsy and had a prominent craniotomy site in the right occipital region, which was tender to touch.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Much of the record includes stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.  In brief wakefulness, there is a clear asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  There is a glimpse of an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the left with a background with generous beta.  From the right hemisphere, there was both a prominent breach rhythm as well as higher amplitude sharply contoured theta frequency activity.  Some of the theta frequency activity is relatively invariant, approximately 5 hertz.  Intermittently, there is more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right occipital region.\\\\nJust prior to photic stimulation, the activity in the right occipital region seems to evolve.  It had been at 5 hertz, just before the photic stimulation increases brief sleep is 6 hertz, and then starts to demonstrate frequency evolution, slowing to 3 to 4 Hz.  At slower frequency activity, there seems to be a notched or subtle underlying sharp wave noted in the occipital region.  There is frequency evolution noted during the 1 hertz stimuli and the evolving activity continued after the 1 hertz stimuli concludes by 3 seconds.  The patient is awake and interacting with the technologist during the stimuli and does not report any clinical symptoms.  The technologist notes no change in the patient\\'s level of awareness.  Additional photic stimulation does not clearly change the overall background, although there is a suggestion again of frequency evolution noted with a subtle onset during the 17 hertz stimuli, but then with frequency evolution with slowing during the 19 hertz stimulation.\\\\nHeart rate 84 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nSingle electrographic, subclinical seizure noted with onset just before the 1 hertz stimulation and potentially 2nd seizure during the 17 hertz stimulation.\\\\nContinuous focal slowing from the right occipital region.\\\\nExcess beta.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing is in the region of the patient\\'s structural lesion.

This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances generally under 5 kilohms. There was 1 montage plugged air noted, which could be accommodated by reformatting.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in maximal wakefulness includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In wakefulness, apparent drowsiness and hyperventilation, there are somewhat asynchronous bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude slowing of the alpha rhythm and frontal theta. These bursts are asynchronous and in some of them there seems to be an area of focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. These high-amplitude bursts are sharply contoured.\\\\nPhotic stimulation did not clearly activate the record. Heart rate: 72 bpm.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to 1- to 3-second bursts of asynchronous slowing with variable maximum noted in hyperventilation in drowsiness.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were seen.

The patient is somnolent.  During the course of the recording, the patient is intubated for seizures at approximately 17:45.  She also receives IV Valproate in order to control the seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record begins on the afternoon of 12/23 and concludes at 19:47 on 12/24.  During this portion of the record, the patient has frequent seizures, which are similar in pattern to that seen on the earlier study performed the same day with repetitive, faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere, followed by gradual evolution over a 20 second period to repetitive theta frequency activity and then evolution to repetitive spike and slow wave activity.  Average seizure duration demonstrates some change, initially on the order of one to three minutes.  Over time, this changes to three to five minutes.  Every hour of the record demonstrates seizures.  Duration of seizure free periods range from 3-6 minutes. At the close of the record, on the morning of the 24th, the patient experiences complex partial seizures.

The patient is obtunded without clear clinical seizures identifiable.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD FOR 12/27-28/02: During this portion of the record, there are frequent spike and slow wave complexes identified particularly on the date of the 27th.  There is also some periodic delta activity, but there are none of the characteristic frequency evolution seizures or the seizures that were characterized by the buzz of the bursts of fast activity.  In the transition after midnight on the 28th, the EEG is lower voltage and overall much more suppressed.  At the conclusion of the first 24 hours at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 29th, the EEG pattern continues to demonstrate a overall low voltage suppressed pattern without additional seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD FOR 12/28-29/02: In this section of the record, the background EEG has some occasional issues with quality.  The patient has some evidence of reactivity.  Despite the technical issues with the EEG, the EEG remains continuous with an increasingly rich background with bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta or theta activity.  There is less of the suppression that was seen in earlier portions of the record and there is some chaotic, higher amplitude arrhythmic delta activity, although the pattern remains low to medium amplitude overall.  The epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere is clearly beginning to abate in this section of the record.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal, continuous bedside EEG monitoring due to:\\\\nInitial status epilepticus with repetitive seizures with a focal or partial pattern followed by intermittent suppression of the seizures and then a pattern of fast activity which was to some extent bilateral.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is diagnostic of a status epilepticus.

Previous history of tonic-clonic seizures.\\\\n\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Norvasc.\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  The major abnormalities occur around the time of photic stimulation.  The tech starts to awaken the patient for photic.  A brief burst lasting just under one second is seen with high amplitude, sharply contoured activity without a really well-defined spike and slow wave complex, but with notched frontal activity.  Reviewing the burst with different montages, it seems to phase reverse slightly to the left.\\\\n\\\\n1 seizure occurred in the EEG lab at 13:51.  This follows photic stimulation, but does not occur during photic stimulation.  The patient is resting quietly with her eyes closed.  As the seizure begins at 13:51:57, no clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The technologist notes the change in behavior.  The patient\\\\xd5s eyes open at 13:52:10.  The technologist asks the patient questions at 13:52:16.  The patient opens her eyes and swallows.  When asked where she is she replies that she is in the neurologist\\\\xd5s office.  She remains somewhat confused in the minutes that follow.  The tech calls the patient at 13:52:39.   At 13:52:46, she sits, staring blankly, and then she starts to rub her eyes in her head.  The tech asks if she is okay.  At this point, when the tech is asking the patient questions, the seizure has ended and the patient is confused.\\\\n\\\\nEEG characteristics of this seizure include the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity, which is more remarkable in the posterior regions.  This seizure seems to start with some low voltage fast activity and then some rhythmic theta, more remarkable in the posterior regions and perhaps maximum in the right posterior region.  Reviewing this seizure with a circle montage, seems to confirm a phase reversal in the right occipitotemporal region but also involving the right central region, nearly isoelectric Cz to C4.  The activity shows frequency evolution and seems to occur in two phases with secondary build-up at 13:52:19 with fast activity and more of a generalized appearance.  The activity ends at 13:52:51 as the patient starts to rub her head with postictal slowing.\\\\n\\\\nHR:  96 BPM.\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. Complex partial seizure, which was difficult to localize and which may have had some generalized features at the start, but with some evidence of focality in the same seizure.\\\\n2. An unusual paroxysmal burst frontal in nature.\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying seizure disorder.

These show shifting asymmetries and may be seen in the right anterior temporal region or left posterior temporal region.  They are superimposed upon a background of essentially theta and delta.  There is a phase reversal, clearly left posterior temporal and right anterior temporal. There is variability in the record with some portions of the record demonstrating more in the way of periodic complexes and some portions of the record demonstrating periodic facial grimacing, which appears almost as an eye movement.  However, looking at the video there is an eye movement, but there is a high amplitude, periodic discharge with associated eye movement and facial twitch and a periodicity of one per second to one per three seconds.

Clinical seizures are noted at 1500 and 1600 hours.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall pattern throughout the night is an unusual pattern.  There are periodic complexes identified from either hemisphere.  As the recording continues and the first seizure is seen at 15:22, there are the triangular shaped waves, which in this case appear to be much more prominent from the right than the left.  This is followed by periodic sharp waves from the right hemisphere, again with this unusual variability at C4, T4, P4, but also picked up at T5, which is the left posterior temporal region.  The periodic complexes follow this.  The team is present, identifies the seizures at the bedside, and initiates Ativan at 15:31 and then additional Phenobarbital at 16:09. Following the Ativan at 15:39, the EEG becomes somewhat discontinuous, but the periodic complexes and the triangular shaped wave forms can be seen in the right hemisphere and left posterior temporal region.  The epileptiform activity waxes and wanes.  There are brief ictal discharges including the triangular shaped waves.  Of note, the left hemisphere is richer in beta frequency activity than the right.  Ativan drip is initiated at 1700 hours.  This produces some intermittent attenuation of the background and a burst suppression pattern is a little asymmetric, the left temporal region is less suppressed than the other regions of the brain.  Over the course of the evening, this pattern gradually improves. It is more continuous with less prominent sharp and slow wave complexes and the triangular shaped waves seen at 2300 hours.  Again, ongoing improvement is seen at 1:00 AM.  The activity is waning and there are not clinical seizures identified at 2:46.  By 2:46, the EEG pattern is increasingly continuous with low voltage fast activity.

The patient reported no clinical symptoms during this EEG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG demonstrates a left temporal triangular shaped wave form, which is periodic and has the morphology of a very simple PLED.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  Within the first 30 seconds of hyperventilation, the periodic activity accelerates and the periodicity increases from approximately one per second to two per second.  This evolves with triangular shaped theta/delta frequency from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions, but with a phase reversal at T3.  This clearly evolves with again increasing frequency in the theta range.  The duration of the activity is approximately 60 seconds and it gradually fades. As it fades, there is a periodic sharply contoured activity and the phase reversal seems to be in the last two PLEDs, more anterior temporal.  This is followed 1.5 seconds later by rhythmic 5.5 Hz activity, which is identified in the occipital regions, left greater than right.  At 8:53:39, the alpha rhythm is returning on the left, but it is still slower on the right.  The technologist confirms with the patient that the patient feels well and there are no clinical signs associated with this one-minute discharge. By 8:54:20, at the end of hyperventilation, the EEG at this time shows a normal pattern.  By 8:54:52, however, the periodic activity starts to evolve from the left and then the 5 Hz activity is identified from the occipital regions, left greater than right, resolving by 8:55:17.  As it resolves, the left periodic triangular shaped discharge persists and does demonstrate a generous field of spread into the posterior temporal and central regions, although remains maximum in the mid-temporal region.

The child is crying in the initial portions of the record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the patient is uncooperative and crying.  He is in the state between wakefulness and drowsiness with a background that is diffusely slow.  There are many artifacts in the record, but no definite asymmetries.  There is a brief portion where a posterior dominant rhythm of up to 7 Hz can be identified, but much of the time the posterior dominant rhythm, if present, is significantly slower.  The child remains active and relatively uncooperative.  The seizure occurs when the child is not moving and is resting quietly.  Prior to the seizure, the background is slow, with some shifting asymmetries, but without a clear lateralization.  The onset of the seizure is a bit subtle.  The first changes are seen at 14:55:55.  There is a suggestion of a discharge in the central region, but is actually picked up bilaterally.  There is rhythmic, high amplitude delta identified at the start of the seizure with some oral automatisms and a cry is seen at 14:56:04.  The initial cry is more of a typical baby-like cry.  At 14:56:11, he slowly extends his arms (the left arm is out and the right arm is up) similar to a sensor posture.  By 14:56:13, however, both arms are extended above the head and typical tonic-clonic activity ensues.  The child continues to vocalize during the tonic-clonic activity.  The activity starts to slow at 14:56:39.  Immediately after the seizure is over, the child returns to crying.  The overall seizure duration is from 14:55:53 to 14:56:49, approximately one minute in duration.  In terms of localization, the onset of the seizure is not well localized at all.  The first changes are really the questionable, almost bilateral changes in the central region followed by rhythmic delta activity, which is present from both hemispheres and not really localized.  By using the various filters and sensitivities, there is a higher amplitude on the left compared to the right, but the high amplitude paroxysmal delta from the frontocentral regions starts to wane by the time both arms are extended and after that, the EEG is obscured by fast activity and muscle with the characteristic tonic-clonic evolution.  Immediately, in the postictal period, the quality of the EEG is partially compromised by loss of electrodes, but the EEG is diffusely slow.  The child is calmer and quieter in the postictal phase, but is not unconscious and it is difficult to interpret the record.

There is a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 6 Hz.  There is superimposed focal slowing identified from the right hemisphere with primarily right anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes, as well as some unusual bursts of slowing from the right hemisphere and a sharp wave with an unusual field of spread including T6, P4, and O2 but with some bilateral occipital representation.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, clearly accentuating the focal epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere particularly right frontocentral and frontotemporal.  In addition, there is poly spike and slow wave activity picked up in the right centrotemporal region.  As this activity builds up just after the close of hyperventilation, the patient is confused.  The replay of this works on the scroll but not on the typical video mode, but the patient remains confused briefly with an EEG essentially obscured by muscle and movement artifact.

The high amplitude periodic epileptiform discharge is accompanied by an otherwise featureless background in comparison to the high amplitude, although there is a smaller amount of theta frequency activity.  There is some variability and there is some theta frequency activity.  The technologist recognizes the pattern early on and notifies the house officers caring for the patient.

This is characterized initially by a subtle increase in theta, particularly from the left hemisphere in association with a periodic activity. Coincident with this, at 12:34:54 and the right arm starts to shake when the theta frequency is identified.  The shaking of the right arm produces some muscle or movement artifact, which partly obscures the EEG but underneath it the initial onset of this seizure seems to have been in the right hemisphere with rhythmic 3.5 to 4 Hz activity from the left hemisphere.  The seizure ends at 9:13:54 for a 60-second duration.

There are occasional bursts of isolated, frontally predominant symmetric high amplitude 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  The overall waking record is at the limits of normal in terms of organization for an individual of this age.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, there are some briefer spike and slow wave complexes, as well as some longer bursts.  In addition, while there is no definite dyshormia, in some sections in the sleep record there is subtle sharply contoured activity in the frontal regions, but no clear asymmetry.\\\\nSEIZURES: There are multiple push buttons by the family: 17:13, 18:14, 19:19, and 20:39.

Given the language (Arabic), it is not clear what the behavior was even when reviewing the video, but these are no seizures and in some cases, when the nurse enters, the patient verbalizes in English that she is fine and that she did not experience any symptoms.\\\\nMultiple bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity are identified.  The majority of these are 8 seconds in duration.  In some cases but not in every case it is possible to identify a clinical correlate, which includes eye blinking.  The resolution of the camera does not permit identification of the facial twitching seen in the lab.  In addition, sometimes the patient scratches her scalp during the seizures.  The minute the discharge stops, the patient is back to her usual self.  She is sitting parallel rather than facing her mother and the mother never identifies these discharges.

There are some computer problems and a loss of data at 3:00 AM, but it appears in wakefulness in the initial portions of the record that the activity is approximately once per hour and the limited data seen on the morning of the 1st suggests that the activity has slowed to a frequency of less than one per hour.\\\\nAt 00:55:45, the patient is sleeping.

The patient is observed to have a significant amount of sweat artifact.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a diffuse theta pattern.  There is sweat artifact picked up, particularly from the electrodes on the right. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle.  There are occasional bursts of slowing from the right central region.\\\\nAt 13:44, the patient has an episode, not well captured on video.  He has rhythmic jerking of the right leg.

The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the EEG demonstrates an abnormal pattern with intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a mixed frequency pattern, lower voltage, primarily with delta and theta, and smaller amounts of beta.  The right hemisphere is relatively sharply contoured.  The left hemisphere demonstrates fast activity, particularly left posterior temporal with a sharp wave in the left temporal region, with a large field of spread including C3, T1, and T5.  Within 20 seconds of the EEG, this activity is clearly evolving to a repetitive theta frequency pattern.  The patient is resting on his left side with eye blinking but without other clinical features.  No testing is performed.  By 18:32:30, the activity begins to slow (seizure was ongoing at the start of this EEG at 18:31).  The activity ebbs and is essentially over by 18:33, but the left hemisphere continues to demonstrate spike and slow wave and irregular poly spike and slow wave activity.  The right hemisphere demonstrates slower delta activity following the seizure.  By 18:36, this activity is building up again and another seizure initiates at 18:36/18:37, gradually slowing, and returning to a somewhat discontinuous pattern by 18:39.  At this juncture, the technician contacts the physicians on duty to inform them of these results and to implement changes in therapy.  Stimulation of the patient at 18:42 is performed.  Unfortunately, at this time, the patient is also experiencing a seizure - his third seizure with an identical pattern seen above.   The stimulation does not change the EEG and, in fact, at 18:43:01, the epileptiform activity seems to be more bilateral.

As the tracing begins, the patient has a facemask on and has difficulty cooperating.  The technologist notes that the patient had a seizure just prior to the beginning of the EEG.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record demonstrate a very slow background, almost featureless, with frontally predominant slow 1 to 2 Hz delta activity, some muscle artifact, and some beta.   Stimulation of the patient produces some theta frequency activity.  The EEG is recorded in two pieces.  The first EEG is 15 minutes and the second EEG has a total recording time of approximately one hour.  The second piece begins at 9:53:22.  In this section of the record, there is a bit more theta and a bit more beta seen in the background.  The background isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite as featureless.  A seizure is identified at 10:05, which is characterized by rhythmic fast activity picked up in the right frontotemporal region with 5 Hz activity superimposed in the right frontocentral region.  It is initially very focal in the first five seconds, but is clearly spreading to the left after the first five seconds.  There is clear frequency evolution with increasing intensity of theta frequency activity, and an increase in the amplitude of the background seen at 10:06:01. Clinically, the patient is on a facemask, and appears to be looking at the video and appears to be agitated.  However, upon reviewing the video, the clinical correlates are initially difficult and then there seems to be more of a clonic jerking at 10:06:21.  The seizure demonstrates a rapid rate for tonic-clonic activity, but with a characteristic muscle artifact.  At 10:06:41, the activity is slowing.  At 10:06:46, again this activity is clearly slowing, and the seizure starts to abate at 10:06:51.  At that time, the jerking stops, but the ictal pattern continues until 10:06:57 with a dramatic background suppression.  The technologist notifies the house officer at that time.  The EEG is markedly suppressed in the postictal recording, but there is some muscle artifact and fast activity. The patient is given Fentanyl at 10:25:56.

Photic  stimulation  was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz,   30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In maximal wakefulness of testing, the background EEG is symmetric, but in relaxed wakefulness there is slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm with intermittent arrhythmic delta activity, which is most prominent in the right mid-to\\\\xc2\\\\xad anterior temporal regions and is at times sharply contoured.  The patient has two unusual events.    The  first  has  an  unclear  onset.    The  patient  is  resting  in  quiet  relaxed wakefulness.   She begins to have a lot of facial movement and then has intermittent, unusual facial twitching with some turning of her head from side to side.  There is also a small degree of titubation of the head.  On the first occasion, which occurs at 9:55, she doesn\\'t  respond to commands and she has this unusual facial twitching.  On the second episode, when given a direct command OPEN YOUR EYES, she opens her eyes.  There are no clear epileptiform abnormalities that accompany these behaviors, and although the patient doesn\\'t follow commands, she does appear to interact with the technologist during these symptoms.   The patient performs photic stimulation during these symptoms and there is no discernable driving response.\\\\nHR:  78 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

Foster child born to mother with a question of drug abuse history.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: None.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Age appropriate quantities of background theta are identified.  Early on in the record, there is a burst of approximately 3 Hz delta from the left hemisphere, particularly the left temporal region.  The burst almost seems to be an artifact, but it is followed by a 15-second burst of frontally predominant, generalized high amplitude 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  This burst is accompanied by a behavioral change.  The child had been resting comfortably.   She opens her eyes almost as if she is startled, with a quick jerk.  In addition, she has involuntary movements for the photic stimulator.  Afterwards, the behavior doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to have been recognized by her caregiver as a seizure.  As she becomes drowsy, there is a very small discrete sharp wave seen five seconds later with another burst of this high amplitude left frontotemporal 3 to 4 Hz activity; again the burst is less than two seconds in duration.  Approximately five seconds later, there is another burst of high amplitude 3 to 4 Hz activity from the right hemisphere, similar to the one that appeared to be an artifact on the left.  This starts out as a high amplitude burst of delta, almost with a double phase reversal, and then there seems to be superimposed upon this some fact activity after 1.5 seconds.  A few seconds later, an additional burst is seen on the left lasting approximately two seconds, again with a suggestion of a poly spike component from the frontal regions and then multiple brief bursts from the left, some of which include a left frontotemporal or anterior temporal spike, which is a different localization than that seen initially.\\\\nThe second seizure in this EEG occurs at 11:52:40.  The child is resting quietly. She has a burst of the high amplitude 3 to 4 Hz activity, and this burst seems to begin on the left, but is bilateral.  Approximately .75 seconds into the burst, there is a frontal spike and slow wave complex that can be seen in both hemispheres, but the delta seems to begin from there and then the characteristic 3.4 Hz spike and slow wave activity is identified.  She opens her eyes at 11:52:47 early on in the seizure.  She looks upwards and she reaches her hands out.  The tech tells her to close her eyes and she appears to be confused.  The tech asks her a question and, in fact, the patient is able to provide an answer.  The patient says \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9calright\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d when asked to close her eyes, and she is able to provide this answer within nearly two seconds at the end of the seizure.  She drifts off to sleep.  Her answer is inappropriate, but she is able to provide some information immediately after the seizure.\\\\nPhotic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.\\\\nHR:  95 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nElectrographic seizures.\\\\nUnusual epileptiform activity with both high amplitude generalized features and focal features.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: The high amplitude, 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity with staring suggests an absence seizure, but in each case this activity was preceded by more clearly focal activity.  In addition, there is unusual focal activity identified from either hemisphere, but the focal activity from either hemisphere seems to be symmetric. There are isolated frontal spike and slow wave discharges that can be seen in inherited epilepsy, but there are also some that seem to be a bit more temporal.  The differential diagnosis for this pattern includes an unusual manifestation of an inherited epilepsy with perhaps some explanation for why some hemispheres differ in terms of their representation of the epileptiform activity versus a localization-related mechanism or a multifocal process.

This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 20 to 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as a small amount of background theta. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with some rhythmic central theta.  Photic stimulation starts to elicit subtle focal slowing from the left temporal region.  This gradually evolves into 3 Hz stimulation, becoming a bit more prominent at that time with a clear burst of rhythmic, high amplitude, sharply contoured delta from the left hemisphere with an unusual field including left hemisphere, centrotemporal, and frontotemporal.  The activity comes and goes during photic stimulation at 13 Hz and 9 Hz and may have been triggered by the initial photic, but seems to be on a pattern that is different with the intermittent photic.  The patient remains comfortable with this intermittent rhythmic sharply contoured periodic delta from the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread and an underlying sharp wave.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and light sleep record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with theta activity and disorganized.  A rare, slow alpha rhythm of 7 Hz, 20 V is seen. Low voltage, frontocentral beta activity is also seen.  Soon after the EEG starts, bursts of 2 to 4 Hz frontally predominant sharp and slow wave complexes lasting for one to two seconds are seen.  In addition, frequent right focal spike and wave complexes are seen in the right hemisphere, mostly in the temporal region, but also in the occipital area.  This focal spike and wave activity occasionally generalized. Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in the amplitude as well as a mixed frequency of activity, with bursts of frontally predominant 2 to 3 Hz sharp and slow wave activity. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  When the patient is aroused, she has some spastic facial movements, but no EEG correlates were recorded.\\\\nHR:  78 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nDiffusely slow and disorganized background.\\\\nBursts of frontally predominant sharp and slow wave activity.\\\\nFocal spike and wave activity in the right temporal and occipital area.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is consistent with a diffuse disorder of cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The epileptiform discharges found in the right hemisphere, as well as the frontally predominant sharp and slow waves supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient. This EEG pattern is usually seen in patients with refractory epilepsy.  The clinical differential should also include Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional posterior slow waves of youth are identified.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing brief bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and wave activity.  As the recording continues, there is additional spike and slow wave activity at the end of hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness, which is again generally symmetric, frontally predominant, but is more in the category of 3 Hz with more after going slow waves.  Other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, an increase in background beta, and POSTS.  Additional spike wave discharges are seen, typically lasting less than a second as the patient makes the transition to sleep.\\\\nPhotic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  Spike and slow wave activity is seen during and around the time of photic, but on only two occasions does it actually occur during photic at 15 Hz and 13 Hz.  The discharges occurring in photic stimulation are not prolonged and are less than one second in duration.  Given the prominent presence of brief spike and wave activity, it cannot be clearly assumed that photic stimulation accentuated the spike and wave activity.\\\\nHR:  72 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nFrontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and wave activity, increasing in HV and drowsiness.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy.

There are occasional voltage asymmetries with higher voltage from the left compared to the right.  There is an occasional T6 sharp wave identified in the record, as well as one in the right frontal region.  There is clear variability and when the child is motorically active, the EEG is richer in theta frequency activity.

A probable subclinical seizure is identified at approximately 13:16.  At that time, there is a burst of epileptiform activity lasting three seconds from the right hemisphere, then approximately two seconds from the left with gradual build up of sharply contoured activity, which seems to be most intense close to the vertex.  This activity demonstrates frequency evolution and wanes over the course of 40 seconds.  Stimulation of the patient occurs throughout the record and does not appear to activate the record.  Following the seizure, the background EEG is suppressed for approximately one minute before the bursts of sharply contoured activity are seen, a bit more sustained from the left than the right.\\\\nHR:  180 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nReplacement of normal background with at times an essentially discontinuous pattern for an infant of this age.\\\\nBursts of independent spike and slow wave activity seen from the left or right hemisphere, sometimes more sustained particularly at the close of the record.

They can overlap with a spindle, which is a normal morphology of stage II sleep.  On one occasion, a pair of spike and wave complexes may be associated with an arousal.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an appropriately organized pattern for a child of this age.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 50 to 70 uV with occasional posterior slow waves of youth.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing rhythmic slowing, particularly in the posterior regions.  Following this, the child becomes drowsy with a decrease in the amplitude, occasional POSTS, and occasional vertex waves. As the child becomes drowsy, there is a left anterior temporal sharp wave of approximately 75 uV in amplitude.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  In the transition to and from sleep, there is an additional, suspicious sharp wave. There are brief portions of the record with hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing identified in stage II sleep.  In the transition from sleep, however, as the child is awakened, there is a burst of frontally predominant 3 Hz spike and wave activity.  This is identified bilaterally, but this two-second burst appears to be maximum from the left frontal region.

In some cases, these are on the order of minutes, but there is no clear postictal slowing or off set, although there are also portions where this activity has disappeared.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  The waking record at times demonstrates rhythmic background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern and at other times there are left temporal sharp waves or spikes.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, March 2, 2006 to March 3, 2006\\\\n?SEIZURE TIME - 16:08: The patient is in bed, lying on his left side.  He had some occasional automatisms.  In contrast to previous sections of the record, there seems to be an initially 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  There is a fair amount of background muscle artifact and the EEG is best reviewed with both a 60 Hz and 35 Hz filter.  It is noted that at 16:05, the patient seems to be awake, but he is in his usual state of delta.  He has some spontaneous movements, which would suggest that the presence of the 8 to 9 Hz alpha frequency activity is actually pathologic in this patient.  Because the first changes actually resemble normal cerebral activity, it is a bit difficult to be entirely certain where the seizure begins.  At 16:06, the background slowing is noted from the right, but the left seems to be a bit more attenuated.  At 16:07, there are rhythmic, repetitive sharp waves from the left.  This is a more prolonged discharge and has some evidence for frequency evolution. The alpha frequency activity appears at 16:07:47.  During this time, there are no clear clinical correlates for this event.  However, at  16:08:17, the activity that looks like normal alpha activity is likely pathologic in this individual.  At 16:08:28, the right arm movements are identified.  They are initially non-specific, but then are somewhat repetitive.  They do produce some artifact, surprisingly more so than one would expect.  The repetitive circular movements continue.  They are at times almost slow and intermittent and at 16:08:46, there is a background of alpha frequency activity bilaterally with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity picked up in the T1-T2 electrodes.  The activity seems to be slowing with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the temporal regions, with some field of spread to the right at 16:08:54.  The patient remains lying on his left side, paying attention to the left, with sporadic jerking in the minutes that follow.  The background at 16:10 may be slower than previously identified.  Additional high amplitude left anterior temporal spikes are seen at 16:10, which is a non-sustained burst.  An individual enters and leaves the room at 16:13.  The individual can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be heard on camera and seems to be just off camera.  Patient is noted to be somewhat tremulous and that individual\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s observation may be what led to the nurse entering the room at 16:19 and pushing the button.  Patient appears confused in this section of the record, with the caregiver holding his hand.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: Much of the drowsy record is a pattern of theta with small amounts of beta.  The trains of sharp waves and spikes seen from the left were not seen at those other times.\\\\nCLINICAL NOTE: The precise description of the behavior described in the nurse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s note is not possible to define.\\\\nIn the sleep recording, there were occasional sharp waves noted from the right with some independent right and left temporal sharp waves.  The alpha frequency activity picked up in the clinical seizure seen at 16:07 was not seen at any other time and differed substantially from other portions of the record, some of which do demonstrate sustained left temporal discharges.  There are occasional left temporal sharp waves, but the majority are from the right.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, March 3, 2006 to March 4, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates prominent portions of the record with rhythmic continuous theta and sharply contoured slowing, as well as sharp waves from the left temporal region.  These include 14:37 when the patient gets up to go to the bathroom.  At that time, there does seem to be some frequency evolution, the patient is with the nurse who notes no clinical change.  While the patient is off camera in the bathroom, the EEG activity does seem to accelerate and afterwards the rhythmic slowing and sharp waves are less prominent.  Single channel artifact is then picked up at 14:46.\\\\nPush buttons for this 24-hour section are reviewed and no seizures are seen in association with the push buttons.\\\\nThe overnight recording for the patient is remarkable for sequential loss of electrodes and great amounts of artifact. Reviewing the seizure detection file, no additional seizures are identified.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, March 4, 2006 to March 5, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has multiple push buttons when he is in need of things.  These include 9:27 AM, 11:00, 11:02, and 13:35.  This section of the record includes many Stellate detections, all of which are artifact.  There are portions of the record with rhythmic mixed theta and delta.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 10:28:45: The patient is in bed on the morning of the 5th.  He was previously asleep in stage II sleep with vertex wave, K complexes, and spindles.  In the time samples previous to this including 10:24, there are trains of spike and slow wave and sharp waves seen from the left temporal region.  There are rare sharp waves identified from the right.  Immediately prior to the discharge, there is some focal slowing and sharp waves, but not as persistent in nature as seen in other epochs of the record.  The first ictal change is seen at 10:28:45 with a burst of low voltage alpha/beta frequency activity.  This is in the left mid-to-posterior temporal regions, spreading to the posterior temporal region at 10:28:55 and then to the anterior temporal region ten seconds later.  The patient is lying on his side, under the sheets.  It is difficult to know which hand starts to tremble, but once the head starts to move at 10:29:25, it is clear that it is the right hand 20 seconds later.  The right hand extends and there are circular movements.  The right hand and then right leg demonstrate tonic and then tonic-clonic activity at 10:29:55.  More generalized tonic-clonic activity is seen ten seconds later.  By 10:32:25, the ictal activity starts to slow with rhythmic paroxysmal slowing.  The seizure demonstrates a clear paroxysmal pattern with slowing and a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  The precise ending of the seizure is partly obscured by muscle and movement artifact, but it seems to be over by 10:33:35.  The patient has a prolonged and profound postictal period with background slowing.  The video indicates a prolonged period where he is trying to sit up.  He seems to be having difficulty using his right side and he falls backwards in bed.  He starts sliding out of bed at 10:39:05 and at 10:40:06 falls on the floor.  Shortly after this, the clinical team enters and notes that the patient is confused and cannot answer questions lucidly.  As the patient recovers, he is lying in bed and again the left temporal sharp and slow wave activity is identified.  The total seizure duration for this individual is approximately four minutes with a relatively prolonged onset prior to the first ictal change, with clear scalp localization in the temporal regions.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 18:10: The patient is sitting in a chair at 18:12:33.  The nurse enters and hands the patient something.  He takes medicine and swallows at 18:12:41.  At 18:12:48, he has a cup of water and medicine in his hand.  The nurse is at the bedside.  At 18:12:54, there is a clear change in frequency of the background with this rhythmic, faster alpha frequency activity.  The patient is sitting.  The nurse is partially obscuring the patient.  He seems to have some automatic behaviors on the right and the left.  The nurse can determine that something is wrong at 18:13:02 when he has an abrupt motor movement.  Unfortunately, the nurse reaches across to help the patient and obscures the camera view of the patient.  The nurse on the camera indicates that there is rapid, clonic activity at 18:13:11.  The video indicates that this is on the right.  The patient seems to have partial impairment of awareness at 18:13:30 and 40, seemingly trying to help the nurse, but then by 18:13:45, this is much more generalized with vocalization.  The clinical team completely obscures the patient, but behind them he seems to be having a tonic-clonic seizure.  This seems to be asymmetric with much more significant tonic-clonic activity on the right compared to the left.  The activity demonstrates frequency evolution, starting to slow at 18:14:25.  The patient remains slumped to the left side at 18:14:36.  The precise end of this seizure is a little difficult to determine.  It is abating by 18:15:24 and is clearly over by 18:15:33.  Total seizure duration is three minutes.  Postictally, there is a fair amount of slowing in the background.  The EKG lead is obscured.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: There is a fair amount of movement artifact when the patient is up and out of bed.  The overall background when he is awake is slow on the right, and intermittently from the left hemisphere there are bursts and trains of left temporal focal slowing and spikes, most of which are in the mid-to-anterior temporal region.  There are also occasional spike and slow wave complexes noted from the right, particularly in the posterior temporal region.  This section of the overnight recording is remarkable for a fair amount of wakefulness captured late at night.  On one or two occasions, he does seem to have an alpha rhythm on the right.

Admitted following a seizure.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Hydrochlorothiazide.\\\\nINTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness  the background EEG is somewhat disorganized  and slow with a bit more slowing from the right hemisphere  in comparison to the left. Intermittent  spontaneous  arousals are observed. Later portions of the record are characterized  by a left temporal spike which appears almost artifactual followed by rhythmic theta. The left temporal spike is followed by rhythmic theta which is actually more prominent on the right and then bilateral temporal theta. After this the patient was observed to have some eye blinking. Testing is not performed, but there is a right temporal high amplitude  irregular periodic spike in psoas complex which follows. The first spike is a 11:32:56, and there is the rhythmic from the right with this bilateral alpha frequency activity at 11:33:34  and periodic activity which seems almost artifactual but is associated with the patient blinking and taking some deep breaths. The periodic sharp waves gradually slow at 11:33:56. The seizure is over at 11:34:02. The patient arouses briefly and drifts off to sleep. At 11:36:42 she starts to move around, and the EEG demonstrates a more awake pattern.

       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 4-year-old male with intermittent staring spells, unresponsive to the mother for three to five seconds at a time, occurring three to five times per day.  History of asthma, otherwise normal birth and development.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: None.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple clinical spells in wakefulness and in sleep.  These are evaluated by the tech and testing is performed to assess responsiveness.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins with the BIOCAL in the first few seconds of the EEG, high amplitude generalized spike and wave activity is seen.  The activity is seen in the first ten seconds of the EEG and occurs in wakefulness.  The recording that follows includes a somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is intermittent occipitally predominant rhythmic delta activity, which is sometimes a bit more prominent on the left than the right.\\\\nThe first well-defined seizure with seizure onset is at 13:08:26.  The child is sitting comfortably.  As is the case with the additional awake seizures, he raises his arms and does not speak.  Testing is performed.  The child speaks afterwards.  He doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to be entirely out of it during the spells.  The EEG demonstrates a generalized, 3 to 4 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  This very first spell seems to be a bit more remarkable in the left compared to the right.  There seems to be a little sharp wave that precedes on the left prior to the generalized discharge. The tech started hyperventilation when the first event occurred.  She gives the patient a code word during the first spell and responsiveness is impaired.  During the second seizure at 13:10:06, the patient is given a color.  Once again, he is noted to just very gently raise his arms above his head.  This discharge is similar to the previous with frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity and poly spike and slow wave activity with abrupt cessation when the event is over.  This one seems to be more synchronous with fast activity seen in the frontal regions, but again has just the slightest bit of focality to the left at the onset.  The third seizure occurs at 13:14:00 following hyperventilation.  This seizure is shorter (most seizures are 20 seconds in duration, this one is 14 seconds).  He lifts his leg gently and puts it back down, but the previously described behavior was not seen with the arms.  Additional seizures including that at 13:16:06 occur when the child is asleep.  The epileptiform activity is essentially identical with a very high amplitude, at times greater than 200 msc spike and slow wave discharges.  This is bilateral, but again there is a bit more intense fast activity in the left frontal region than the right.  Following this, the patient is drowsy but not entirely asleep, although there is some stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the drowsy pattern, there is a bit of fast activity in the frontocentral regions.  The fifth seizure is at 13:18:36 with the patient drifting off to sleep.  No clinical signs are seen for this drowsy individual, but testing is not performed with the intention to let the child fall asleep.  Immediately after the discharge, a vertex wave can be seen supporting the appearance of this activity as the child drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The sixth seizure is recorded in stage II sleep at 13:22:46, ending at 13:32:56.  No clinical signs or symptoms are noted with this.  Additional, brief or less than 10 second discharges are also seen in sleep.  There are a handful of poly spike discharges noted in this sleep record, but mostly it is the longer discharges.  An additional discharge is observed at 13:27:36, which seems to slightly disrupt sleep.\\\\nStimulation does not elicit a photoparoxysmal response.\\\\nHR:  100 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nSpontaneous and hyperventilation-induced frontally predominant bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity.\\\\nRare bursts of fast activity from the left frontal region in sleep.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: On the whole, this EEG is most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy with frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  There are some features raising the possibility of a secondarily generalized mechanism including the left frontal activity seen at the onset of this.  This may represent the orientation of the dipole for this individual.  The seizures that occurred were relatively typical of absence seizures.  Correlation with clinical history and imaging is appropriate.\\\\nOf note, the attending physician of record was notified during the EEG.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The overall background is somewhat disorganized and there is some shifting asymmetries particularly in the temporal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed and seems to increase some of the shifting and slowing, and on one occasion there is a bit more rhythmic alpha frequency activity from the left hemisphere in comparison to the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, following HV, this is seen on one or two occasions in the transition to sleep.   Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  In the transition to sleep, a bit more isolated focal 3 to 4 Hz activity is seen from the left temporal region.

The child is intubated and this is a bedside recording.  There are no clinical notes regarding the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s clinical condition or a description of seizures, and none are entered into the document.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This continuous video EEG monitoring begins at 15:50.  The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern with a bit more arrhythmic delta in the posterior regions.  There is a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex from the left hemisphere, maximum in the occipital regions, but with a generous field of spread.  In addition, there are occasional spike and slow wave complexes picked up in the right hemisphere, again with a generous field of spread in the centrotemporal regions with variable maximum.  There are no push button events to indicate that the clinical team identified seizures.\\\\nAt 23:42, there are bursts of frontal delta.  The record from 1500 to 2300 hours shows increasing amounts of beta.  The spiking continues.  The child is seen on the video.  He is lying supine, flaccid, and motionless.\\\\nPentobarbital 65 mg is given at midnight, producing frontal delta, and increasing amounts of Pentobarbital are given at 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM, and 9:00 AM, as well as 3:00 AM.  The recording continues to demonstrate a delta pattern with generous amounts of beta.  After midnight, when the child receives the Pentobarb, the epileptiform activity decreases substantially.\\\\nLooking through the Stellate detection files, there is an event at 01:54.  This demonstrates an increasingly discontinuous pattern with flattening and then there is a burst of fast activity, which is most intense at the midline and on the right.  There are no clinical correlates noted with this burst.  Around this time, occasional discrete spike and spike and slow waves or sharp waves are noted from the right central region and the left occipital region.\\\\nThe next Stellate detection is at 3:41 and demonstrates intermittent bursts of fast activity from the central regions, left or right, in a background almost in burst suppression but not quite.  There are intermittent bursts of cerebral activity, as well as occasional focal spikes from the right central or left occipital region.  No clinical signs or symptoms accompany this Stellate detection.\\\\nIntermittent recording from 1:00 AM through the next morning includes the Stellate detections at 3:41, 3:59, 4:02, 4:05, 4:22, and 4:35.  These patterns are similar to the entire pattern, which is one of almost a discontinuous-type pattern with a burst of approximately three seconds of fast activity, which is maximum in the central regions, sometimes a bit more on the left and sometimes on the right.  This is followed by a burst of mixed frequency, chaotic cerebral activity, sometimes with a sharp wave and sometimes followed by an attenuation.  The attenuation or suppression may be asymmetric, and may be depressed on the right or left side.  In addition, the bursts of fast activity typically precede the bursts of cerebral activity, but on occasion follow it.  The typical duration is approximately three seconds.  By 5:21 AM, the EEG demonstrates a more continuous pattern with frontal delta.  Again, no clinical signs are noted and the pattern at this time demonstrates less in the way of epileptiform activity.  It is difficult to correlate this with the infusion of the barbiturates, as the child is receiving Phenobarbital and Pentobarbital at the same time.  However, the child would have received 100 mg of Phenobarbital at 5:00 AM and there is a brief hiatus at that time with the Pentobarb.  At 7:48, the EEG becomes more discontinuous.  This would follow the administration of the Pentobarb, which at that point has increased from 0.65 ml/hr to 0.78 ml/hr.  No clinical signs or symptoms can be seen on the video, but there is a clear discontinuous pattern with a beta buzz from the left or right frontocentral regions.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 February 7, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Acyclovir, Pentobarbital, and Phenobarbital.  The Pentobarbital drip starts at 0.78 ml/hr to 1.04 ml/hr.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: The nurses\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 observations indicate that at 8:00 AM, there was an episode with left arm and left eye twitching and the patient received 65 mg of Pentobarbital bolus.  It is not possible to see the eye twitching or the examination of the patient during the seizure on the video. The next recorded seizure is at 2:00 PM on the 7th.\\\\nEVENT TIME 13:54: The background EEG is markedly suppressed.  It is nearly featureless.  The child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s father is at the bedside.  When there is cerebral activity, it is sharply contoured and the occasional right central sharp wave is seen in the background.  There is the intermittent three-second burst of beta identified from the right hemisphere, again lasting approximately three seconds.  At this point in time, the same burst of fast activity is seen, but it slowed to approximately alpha frequency at 10 Hz.  It is not possible to see if there is a clinical correlate with this.  Additional bursts are seen at 13:58 with two bursts in close approximation.  Extended video is reviewed at 2:00 AM.  There is a parent at the bedside who does not appear to observe any change in the child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s behavior, and nothing is noted on the video.\\\\nIn the hours that follow, there are intermittent bursts lasting approximately a few seconds in duration of what is now alpha frequency activity most intense in the right hemisphere.  There are intermittent spike and slow wave complexes from the left occipital region and in the right hemisphere, particularly the centrotemporal region with a generous field of spread.  The bursts of beta disrupt the overall suppressed pattern.\\\\nThe nurses indicate that the Pentobarb dose varies between 1.04 ml/hr at 9:30 AM to 0.39 ml/hr at 4:00 PM.  In this section of the record, there doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to be a substantial change in terms of the background, which demonstrates an intermittently discontinuous pattern and the three-second periods of beta frequency activity.\\\\nThe Pentobarbital continues at a rate of 0.78 ml/hr (3 mg/kg/hr).  At the close of the record, the child does appear to be comatose, but the bursts of fast activity are seen in this context.\\\\n\\\\nHR:  150 to 180 BPM.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 February 8, 2006 to February 9, 2006\\\\nINTRODUCTION: This section of the record runs from 8:42 to 13:25.  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the neonatal ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The child is currently in a Pentobarb coma with high dose Phenobarbital.  He is intubated and comatose.  Review of the video does not identify a clinical correlate.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is at times discontinuous and at other times very low voltage.  In this low voltage, suppressed background, there are intermittent spike and slow wave complexes identified from either hemisphere including the left occipital or right centrotemporal.\\\\nThere are intermittent bursts of fast activity.  These are identical to the previously described bursts of beta frequency activity, but are now primarily alpha frequency activity, lasting typically three seconds in duration.  These appear with three different patterns.  The first pattern is that seen in the previous epochs with a burst of fast activity either from both hemispheres or from one hemisphere or the other followed by arrhythmic delta.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of activity, which can be seen in one hemisphere with a transition to the other hemisphere, and the bursts of delta may precede or follow the burst of fast activity.  There are also some bursts with more of a bilateral representation.  They are followed by the chaotic delta and in some occasions there is some spiking picked up in the left hemisphere before the event is maximum on the left.  With the use of a sensitivity of 3 uV per minute, the EEG does appear to be less continuous with rhythmic slowing and frequent epileptiform discharges.  There is some variability in the degree of suppression and the frequency of the bursts of fact activity, but there is no sustained period longer than several minutes without these likely epileptiform discharges.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 February 8, 2006 to February 9, 2006 Continued\\\\nINTRODUCTION: During this section of the record, the observation was that the child was comatose.  There are no reports of twitching in this portion of the record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG starts at 1400 hours.  In place of the previously described bursts of beta and alpha frequency activity, there are bursts of rhythmic activity, which are monomorphic, in the range of 7 to 10 Hz, lasting three and at times 10 seconds.  These gradually decrease and are less apparent by 1:00 AM.  In the 1:00 AM record that follows, there are frequent high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes in a very irritative brain, but there are no discernable clinical seizures and there are no additional bursts of that rhythmic monomorphic activity that was initially beta then slowing to alpha.\\\\nThis section of the record concludes at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 9th.  The pattern at the conclusion includes bursts of high amplitude, spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere particularly the centrotemporal region and the left occipital.  It is intermittently discontinuous with an irritative-looking pattern, but there are no sustained bursts of that rhythmic activity seen previously.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 9, 2006 to February 10, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Phenytoin, and Midazolam.  Starting at 1:00 PM Phenobarbital.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: This continuous video EEG monitoring begins at 11:00 AM and continues to the morning of the 10th.  During this section, the patient received Phenytoin in the morning and was started on a Versed drip at .5 mg/kg/hr.\\\\nOne clinical event characterized by eye flutter was reported at 2200 hours, but could not be identified subsequently.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the early portions of the record, the background EEG demonstrates a pattern, which is intermittently suppressed with occasional sharp waves from the left occipital and right centrotemporal regions.  There is some variability in the record with some portions of the record more suppressed than others.  There are also bursts of sharply contoured activity.\\\\nThe Versed is started at 2:00 PM.  This is associated with an attenuation of the background.  There is a decrease in the sharp waves noted in the background and no clinical seizures were recorded.  At the close of the record, the EEG is low voltage, not entirely discontinuous, with a marked decrease in the fast activity.\\\\nDuring this section of the record, none of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bursts of fast activity were identified.\\\\nHR: 122 BPM.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 10, 2006 to February 11, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Midazolam with doses ranging from 0.5 to 0.2, Phenobarbital, and others.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The medication printout does not tag all of the medication changes, but at 13:18, the Versed was decreased to 0.3 mg/kg/hr.  The patient remains intubated and poorly responsive.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial background, there is a mixed frequency pattern.  The pattern includes arrhythmic slow delta and smaller amounts of theta.  In the initial portions of the record, there is some subtle variability with stimuli.  There is also a bit of asymmetry with a bit more faster frequency activity on the right.\\\\nOver the course of time, the Versed dose is reduced to 2 mg/hr at 16:28:53.  It is reduced again at 18:27:29.  It isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until after midnight on the morning of the 11th that the spiking really increases and there is an increase in epileptiform activity in the left occipital region.\\\\nBy the close of the recording on the morning of the 11th, the EEG is continuous. There is a left occipital spike seen and some EKG artifact.  The overall background is rich in delta with some alpha and theta frequency activity and some fast activity.\\\\nA clinical seizure was reported at 10:00 AM, which is not included in this piece of the recording, which ended at 9:23.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 11, 2006 to February 12, 2006\\\\nINTRODUCTION: In this portion of the record, the child is heavily sedated.  The record starts on the morning of the 11th.  At that time, the Versed drip had been increased to .2 because of clinical events.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the EEG is remarkable for frequent left occipital spiking.  It is unique in that there is more fast activity from the right posterior region, and this is the first time that a right posterior temporal sharp wave has been identified.  The record is variable with portions of the record demonstrating more delta than others.  This section is remarkable for few comments, although there were later reports that this child had clinical events during this section of the record.  As the recording continues at 14:39, there is more fast activity and a bit more asymmetry with a bit less delta from the right.  On the morning of the 11th, there is an event described by the nurse as a seizure.  The tech makes a comment at 10:10 AM.  The video is reviewed, which shows the nurse at the bedside.  The video failed to identify any EEG changes that would be referable to this and the child does not seem to be moving.  The child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face is not well defined, but there isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t any arm movement. Right hand circular movements at 11:00 AM on the 11th were not visualized by the video and there was no EEG correlate.\\\\nBy 11:00 PM on the 11th, the background is more symmetric, richer in faster frequency activity.  Right arm movement of the child is noted at midnight, although there is an individual at the bedside.  The child is being suctioned, which might account for the movement.  The nurses had observed that the behaviors that they were calling seizures were stimulus sensitive.  The EEG record on the morning of the 12th demonstrates a pattern rich in faster frequency activity, as well as theta.  There are frequent spike and slow wave complexes, left occipital, right posterior temporal, and fewer in the right central region.  There are no definite bursts of alpha and beta frequency activity.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 12, 2006 to February 13, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Phenytoin, Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Phenobarbital.  Vecuronium is given at 10:19:46.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG in this portion of the record is continuous, rich in theta and delta frequency activity with fast activity.  In this section of the record, there is epileptiform activity including right occipital or right posterior temporal, as well as left, but there are few of the bursts of fast activity.  Although there were reports that the child had seizures on this day, they are not marked in the EEG and in that the behaviors were not associated with a change in the EEG, it is not possible to identify them, even with the video camera.  As the recording continues, it is not clear when the dose of Versed was increased.  There is some twitching seen at 20:38, and the nurses are working at the bedside at 20:41.  By 22:54, the bursts of fast activity have returned, lasting now approximately two seconds, not so clearly associated or followed with delta.  These are relatively synchronous in both hemispheres are this time.  There are no clinical notes regarding whether or not these were considered significant, but by midnight, it appears that the Versed drip may have been increased as the background is slower than previously identified and is sometimes discontinuous.  By 2:00 AM, the EEG is increasingly continuous, however, there are also focal spikes and the bursts of the fact activity are seen in what is now a somewhat continuous record.  This would also be considered a new pattern for this child.\\\\nAt 10:38 infusion with Dilantin is given to the patient. Right hand movements are noted by the nurse at 18:36:27.  This was somewhat difficult to discern on the video, but no EEG correlate. Right hand and arm movements were noted on the 12th at 8:27 and 9:38, with more pronounced motor activity and a more sustained seizure.  Again, this was without clear correlate, however, in this case, it is quite possible that there was an underlying ictal discharge not otherwise seen.  Ditto 9:45.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 13, 2006 to February 14, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG on the morning of the 13th, continues to show the discontinuous pattern with fast activity.  Also, there is a fine tremor of the right hand.  The EEG revealed no clear EEG correlate, but muscle artifact, which is sustained and may very well have an underlying ictal pattern not well visualized by scalp EEG.  Ditto 7:43:52 and 8:21.\\\\nThere is a clinical seizure that occurs at 12:20:05 after the nurse moves the patient.  This can be reviewed on the video.  The review begins at 2:18.  At that time, the EEG shows a somewhat discontinuous pattern with beta bursts and occipital spiking.  The nurse enters at 12:20:00.  She starts by touching the child on the left at 12:20:10.  As she is touching the patient at 12:20:11, the EEG changes from what is a higher amplitude pattern with mixed delta and theta and the intermittent bursts of beta.  There is an attenuation in frequency and it looks like there is fast activity out of the right hemisphere.  Immediately as she starts touching him, the right arm starts moving in an almost circular fashion \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 almost a semi-purposeful fashion.  The nurse notes that the child is turning to the right.  There is some frontal delta and some spiking in the occipital regions bilaterally.  The EEG seems to change for the third time in this seizure at 20:20:41 with more muscle artifact.  The circular movements are noted with the right hand and there is another movement in the left hand.  The right arm is down and the left hand is more flexed and extended, not entirely like a fenster posturing but with that suggestion.  During this time, the EEG doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clear ictal pattern.  There may be some underlying spiking in the left posterior temporal region.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 12:20: On Monday, February 13th, the motor activity continues as long as the child has tactile stimulation.  At 12:31, there is what may be artifact, but may also be part of this child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unusual epileptiform appearance out of the right hemisphere with a combination of fast activity and muscle artifact.\\\\nBy 16:57, the EEG has returned to its usual pattern with bursts of beta activity and the occipital spike with less in the way of the right occipital spike or the other epileptiform features.  There are other portions of the record where muscle artifact is seen including 19:57.  This is a long event and seems to start with handling of the patient.  It begins with circular movements of the right hand, muscle artifact on the right, and right eye deviation.  The occipital spiking is not seen at that time.  There is somewhat of an increase in faster frequency activity in the overall background, but there is no clear ictal pattern.  At 19:59:19, the nurses are handling the patient during the seizure and the arm continues to move.\\\\nDilantin infusion.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, February 14, 2006 to February 15, 2006\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside.  In this section of the record, no clinical seizures are noted.  The patient is on a Versed drip of 6.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins, the background is continuous with a mixed frequency pattern. At 12:51:21, epileptiform activity is apparent in a background that is slower than the initial morning recording.  In addition, as the recording continues over the course of the 14th, there are occasional bursts of fast activity occurring with bursts now under three seconds, more typically on the order of two seconds, maximum at the midline with some occasional predisposition to the right or the left side is seen.  These no longer seem to be associated with the same bursts of delta that were previously identified.  This section of the record is recorded in two pieces.  The first piece concludes at 16:21, and at that time, left, quick bursts of fast activity are seen, but the left occipital spiking is noted.  Again, no clinical correlates are noted.\\\\nThe additional section of the recording continues to show a child who is unresponsive.  The late afternoon and overnight recording again shows relatively frequent left occipital spike and wave complexes, as well as the occasional bursts of fast activity.  At times, the record is somewhat discontinuous and in other portions of the record, the record is richer in mixed beta and delta, but at some points when it is relatively rich in this activity, there is both frequent left occipital spiking and the bursts of beta.\\\\nHR:  120 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: This prolonged video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:\\\\nAn unusual form of status epilepticus with what appeared to be clinically, sometimes on the video and sometimes by eye witnessed accounts, an unusual seizure which at times was stimulus sensitive, at times marked, and at other times more subtle with circular movements of the right hand or clonic movements of the right side of the body.  It was almost a fenster posture of the left hand and/or elevation of the left leg.  These activities were sometimes associated with eye flutter.\\\\nAfter the administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates, bursts of fast activity were seen, which seemed to be ictal in nature, preceded or followed by bursts of delta.\\\\nEpileptiform foci left occipital, right central, and as the recording continued, right posterior temporal.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a very marked underlying epileptiform disorder.  The behaviors without clear clinical correlates do appear to be seizures, particularly as some subtle behaviors seem to have an underlying change in the EEG.  Of note, this activity responded early on to Versed or to high dose barbiturates, but then seemed to breakthrough.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

There seems to be an artifact with some muscle activity, but there also seems to be a bifrontal spike and slow wave complex, which is high in amplitude.  Examination of the patient fails to identify a clinical correlate with this movement.  The patient is examined in detail.  While she does seem to have some element of stimulus-induced ocular myoclonus, the EEG pattern does not seem to have a relationship to the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motor activity and does seem to wax and wane.  It is typically in the theta frequency range, but slows to delta and then builds up again.  There is sometimes a poly spike component and it is on occasion faster, reaching up to a 7 to 8 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  The activity is bilateral, poorly localized.  As is seen in an epileptiform discharge, the activity occasionally pauses or suppresses for a second and then builds up again.\\\\nHR:  120 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nOngoing epileptiform pattern, which is compatible with a subclinical form of status epilepticus.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: Interestingly, this patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motor activity does not correlate with the EEG.

The activity is sharply contoured.   There are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta, some of which are more remarkable from the right compared to the left with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere and a bit more sharply contoured activity in the right central region, but without definitive spike and slow wave complexes.  Apparent vertex waves are identified, although it is not entirely clear what the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleep state is.  The technologist avoids stimulating the patient as that seems to elicit some of her agitation.  When the video is reviewed, the portions of the record with the vertex activity demonstrates a relatively quiet individual, but without testing, it is impossible to know whether or not the patient is in fact asleep.  She is noted to have spontaneous movements of the left hand and sits with the left hand somewhat clenched.\\\\nHR:  90 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nGeneralized background slowing with a mixture of rhythmic theta and arrhythmic delta.\\\\nShifting arrhythmic delta sometimes more prominent in the right hemisphere.\\\\nBursts of generalized frontal delta.\\\\nConcerning, pathological vertex waves noted for this individual.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were seen.

The patient is awake and moving about, but has active ongoing myoclonus.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  It is reasonably well organized with an alpha rhythm at times reaching 7 Hz, sometimes slower.  There is background theta, but the overall organization is pretty good.  There are intermittent high amplitude bursts of myoclonus, some of which produced just artifact but which are clearly followed by an after going slow wave.  They appear to be generalized although they are high enough amplitude that localization is quite challenging. On one or two occasions, they may appear to the right of the midline. Most, however, seem to be at the midline.  The after going slow wave is 4 to 5 Hz.  To attempt to localize requires a sensitivity of 20 to 30 uV resulting in an overall suppression of the background.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in the background slowing.  At times, there is almost a poly spike and wave component to the discharges.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta, and the myoclonic activity increases.\\\\nHR:  84 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nHigh amplitude generalized spike and wave activity, which primarily produces a muscle artifact for the spike but with a clear after going slow wave.\\\\nMild background slowing and disorganization.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overall background continues to improve compared to previous sections of the record.

At least in the initial portions of the record, where clinical comments are available, the patient is described as clinically seizing with involuntary movements of the left hand.  She is intubated and poorly responsive.  In the later portions of the record, clinical correlates of the seizures include subtle jerking of the left hand against the bed rail and subtle movements of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG demonstrates ongoing, repetitive seizures emanating from the right hemisphere.  The seizures start as the EEG opens with sharply contoured theta frequency activity and sharp waves maximum from the right frontotemporal region with clear frequency evolution.  The seizures are approximately 45 seconds, but actual seizure onset and off set is difficult and seizures occur within a minute at the end of the first seizure.  In the more vigorous seizures, the patient has some movement of the left foot.  In some of them, there is simply tremulousness of the left.

Review of the video does not discern involuntary movements in association with epileptiform activity.  However, although the EEG demonstrates an intermittent burst suppression, in the portions of the EEG that are continuous the patient demonstrates seizures characterized by fast activity and sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly the right anterior temporal region.

Towards the close of the record on the 25th, the EEG is more continuous, but there is ongoing sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly the right anterior temporal with some frequency evolution seen at that time.  At the close of the record, the EEG is no longer in burst suppression and there is more of a pattern of uniform theta.  An electrographic seizure is identified at 7:43 and the recording ends at 8:08 suggesting that the overall frequency of seizures has decreased from nearly continuous to at least hourly.\\\\nHR:  96 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nOngoing status epilepticus seen at some points in the overnight recording even in the setting of a burst suppression pattern.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: If this patient has renal failure, this may have made the epileptiform activity more difficult to control.

The patient is intubated and unresponsive, with some occasional body movements. Tactile stimulation of the patient was performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background EEG is of theta frequency range.  There are frequent spike waves originating from the right hemisphere with a variable field of spread.  At times, these spike and sharp wave complexes seem to have a bifrontal field with a right hemispheric preponderance.  Occasionally, this field seems to be posterior temporal.  These sharp waves localize frequently to T4. There is also occasional right temporal delta.\\\\nHR:  114 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nSpike wave complexes that originate from the right hemisphere.\\\\nBackground slowing.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: No electrographic seizures were seen.  The overall background has improved and the frequent right hemispheric discharges appear as PLEDS, which, in the context of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s imaging studies, suggests ongoing cortical irritability.

The patient is intubated, initially somewhat agitated, and poorly responsive.  There is significant ED artifact identified.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are remarkable for a fair amount of muscle and other ICU artifact.  The overall pattern is low voltage and when the movement and muscle artifact is eliminated, there is very little remaining of the EEG.  In the interpretable portions of the record, however, both eye movement artifact and occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves, as well as sharply contoured theta activity is seen.  Throughout this record, the patient is responsive, demonstrating spontaneous and purposeful movements.  By 18:51, the background muscle has dropped out and frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves can be identified, which are of medium amplitude with a generous field of spread including the left frontal and frontotemporal regions.  Stimulation of the patient at that time again produces additional muscle artifact.\\\\nHR:  66 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nAbnormal background with primarily a low voltage beta pattern.\\\\nFrequent left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in the valuable portions of the recording.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial or localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.

The montage is unchanged.  No clinical seizures are identified by the clinical team, but subclinical seizures can be identified with the nurse at the bedside during this.\\\\nINTERICTAL ACTIVITY: In the interictal section, there are high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes, some of which are very high amplitude with a generous field of spread; in some cases appearing maximum at contact LM12 rather than 1, 2, and other smaller spikes in the mesial temporal region, again typically anteriorly although somewhat LM8.  There is some delta picked up at LM13, 14 and 18, 19, 20.  There is clear evidence of a change in the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mental status with awake and asleep patterns identified.\\\\nThere is single filled channel, almost artifactual-looking discharges, with a maximum at LL14 involving 13, 14, and 15 on the lateral temporal chain, which would be in the posterior section of the third row of intracranial electrodes.  On the single channel, on some occasions, it does seem to wax and wane and it does appear prior to the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seizure.  It may or may not correlate with some of the delta seen in the more lateral electrodes of the LM or mesial-placed grid.\\\\nThe EEG was reviewed well before the event.  The patient had been sleeping until 20:46:16.  The nurse walks in and startles the patient.  This produces a dramatic change in the EEG with an attenuation compatible with an alerting.  Prior to this time, there had been some spiking in some of the anterior contacts of both grids \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the right strip electrode remaining quiet.  At 20:46:44, there is the appearance of rhythmic activity out of the LL14 contact.  It looks single channel and artifactual, however, the LL9, 10 electrode seemed to be involved perhaps seven seconds into this discharge and does seem to have a correlation with this.   There is this activity, which seems to be electropositive at LL14, but it does seem to have a relationship to the activity at LL9, 10.  This can be seen at 20:46:57.  By 20:47:15, there is more clear involvement of the subtemporal grid with involvement of LM8, 9, 10, and LM13, 14, 15.  The activity continues with this electropositive activity at LL14, but there is a pattern of repetitive spiking at LL11, 12.\\\\nWith a seizure start time of 20:47:12, by 20:47:26, there is involvement in the left subtemporal chain and at 20:48:02, there is a pattern of repetitive spike at LM8, 9, 10, as well as LM12, 13, 14, which is compatible with the lateral electrodes from the mesial strip.  Coincident with this, there is this rhythmic electropositive activity at contact 13, but with more repetitive spike activity at LM11, 12, and that 11, 12 activity is similar to the onset of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first seizure on the first day.\\\\nThe nurse is at the bedside and no clinical changes are identified.\\\\nThe seizure shows gradual evolution of frequency, which is most prominent in the chain of electrodes LM11 through 15, demonstrating paroxysmal slowing with abrupt termination at 20:48:40.

The best localization for this one is in the same lateral temporal strip, but posterior to the first one.  There are concerns that the actual onset of the seizure might have been a bit challenging because of the fact that there is an unusual field with electropositivity at 14 and then the train of epileptiform activity that follows that.\\\\n\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, July 16, 2006 to July 17, 2006\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using intracranial electrodes. The nurses do not identify any seizures, the computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures, and review of the data does not identify clinically subclinical seizures.\\\\nINTERICTAL SPIKING: Review of the EEG demonstrates occasional high amplitude mesial temporal spiking from the left subtemporal grid.  There are rare portions of the record with some spiking at LM14, 15 as well.  There is occasional fast activity in the strips.  In the lateral grid, there are two patterns with spiking at LL16, 17 and delta in the posterior contacts of the strips.\\\\n\\\\nThere seems to be an observation that there is more spiking at LL16, 17 when there is no spiking in the mesial temporal area or vice versa.\\\\n\\\\nThere is an unusual discharge noted at 01:27 AM, which is asymptomatic.  The patient is awake at the time.  The two strips are compared.  There is some periodic delta from the first two strips in the LL grid which includes 1 through 10 followed by some periodic delta.

There are bursts of fast activity, and on rare occasions the same fast activity is seen in the right temporal strip.  By 8:00 AM, the ground is lost and this seems to tamp down the activity from the left mesial and anterior contacts in the LM or subtemporal grip.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the left lateral neocortical grid, there are portions where there is variability with 2 Hz, almost monomorphic or mono-channel delta seen at contacts 16 and then migrating to 19, 20 and occasionally more diffusely throughout.  The LL strip has variability with some portions of the record being much more sharply contoured than others and without as much in the way of underlying epileptogenic activity.  At 3:10 AM, an alpha theta pattern is picked up throughout.  The pattern resembles a somewhat awake or drowsy, well-organized cortical pattern.  There is some spiking seen at 3:12:06 out of LM13, 14; 14, 15, but there is no clear ictal nature to this discharge.  The theta frequency activity doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t evolve as would be anticipated in a seizure.\\\\n\\\\nHR: 80 BPM.\\\\n\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, July 18, 2006 to July 19, 2006\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using intracranial electrodes. The nurses do not identify any seizures, the computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures, and review of the data does not identify clinically subclinical seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the EEG continues to show high amplitude spiking in the left mesial electrodes primarily in the first three rows, but some in the fourth.  There is some high amplitude more diffuse spikes and some that have a more restricted field in the first or the second contacts.  There seems to be an artifact with delta picked up at LM13, 14 and at LL17, 18.  Because of that delta, the tech removes that from the chain.  At 17:10 and at 18:39, there is a pattern of a greater fast activity and some theta activity from the left lateral grid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 in this case, seen primarily in the first chain at LL2, 3; 3, 4; 4, 5, but without clinical correlate.\\\\nHR: 70 BPM.\\\\nCOMMENT: The LL strips seem to be significantly quieter than it had been in previous days.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, July 20, 2006 to July 21, 2006\\\\nSEIZURE \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Time 10:16 AM on 7/20/06:  The patient is in bed.  She is watching television or staring off into space.  She is not aware of any specific behavioral changes.  She is later not aware that she has been incontinent.  The EEG demonstrates a subtle pattern of repetitive sharps at LL19, 20.  These are of medium amplitude, 5 to 7 Hz, and then transitions to a pattern of a repetitive spike, which can be clearly differentiated from EKG and, in fact, seems to be electronegative at LL20.  This is seen at 10:17:23 and 10:17:24.  The left subtemporal grid appears to be relatively uninvolved.  There is some electronegativity at LM14, 15, which would be in the same approximate region.  There is also a little bit of a beta buzz identifiable in the LM1, 2, but this does not seem in any way differentiated from the repetitive high amplitude approximately 1 to 2 Hz spike at LL19, 20.  This is associated with a field of delta in LL13, 14; 14, 15, which would be posterior in the superior temporal gyrus, assuming that LL19, 20 is the middle temporal gyrus.  This activity clearly involves the superior temporal strip by 10:23:53.  It remains at approximately 2 Hz.  It stops at 10:23:33.  By the time the seizures ends, the left LM subtemporal strip is involved; in fact, contacts LM13, 14, which would have been lateral neocortical in the third strip, are involved at 10:21:13, and the pattern of repetitive spiking can be seen at 10:21:20.  The activity stops quite clearly in the lateral temporal strip and in the subtemporal at contacts 13, 14, the spiking seems to peter out more than stopping paroxysmal with more of a field and is associated with focal delta at 10:23:10.  The right subtemporal strip remains uninvolved.  This activity waxes and wanes and returns at 10:26:07, but is actually unique at that point in that there is electropositivity at 13, 14.  The activity from the lateral temporal grid builds back up at 10:26:20, however, there is also activity in the subtemporal strip suggesting ongoing enhancement of epileptogenicity with, in this case, a lateral temporal strip likely building up to the activity seen at LM13, 14 at 10:26:33.  At the same time, there is clearly a beta buzz with frequency evolution and an electropositivity throughout the strips LL13, 14, 15.  The second seizure is clearly spreading at 10:27:04, with more extensive involvement in the lateral temporal chain, and looking at the subtemporal strip, there is a pattern of exquisite spiking at LM8, 9 and then really a more vigorous pattern at 10:27:13.  By 10:29:43, it now involves LM4, 5.  The seizure has an unusual pattern because it seems to generate more anteriorly over time so it starts out neocortically and posteriorly and by 10:30:14, it is actually in the lateral temporal strips LM3, 4 and LM4, 5, which can clearly be identified using a higher sensitivity of 20.  At that time, LL11, 12 and LL12, 13 demonstrate this spiking.  The seizure seems to wax and wane in the lateral temporal strip, but is over at 11:32.  In that strip, in the lateral temporal grid and in the subtemporal grid, the off-set is not quite as clear, but it seems to peter out at 10:30:55, essentially perhaps a minute earlier.\\\\nOf note, the seizure that starts at 10:17 and is localized to contacts LL19, 20, seems to build up and give rise to the second seizure, which is at 10:26 and starts LL13, 14.  That second seizure seems to mediate more towards the subtemporal and anteriotemporal spread. Of note, the seizure is associated with head turning and is not associated with profound autonomic changes seen with the seizures that generated to the frontal region that had a tonic-clonic component.\\\\nSEIZURE \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Time 02:19 AM on 7/20/06:  The patient is asleep.  The EEG prior to this seizure is reviewed.  There are transitions to and from sleep.  There are also one or two episodes where the patient briefly disconnects herself; this can be confirmed not to be an electrodecremental response because the EEG lead is involved.  Although there is waxing and waning, there is a sharp wave picked up in the most anterior contacts LL11, 12 and LL16, 17.  There is the delta that waxes and wanes, and there is intermittent increased beta activity in the frontal regions.  The spiking waxes and wanes and can be seen at 02:23 and is quite prominent at 02:23:17.\\\\nThis seizure has only the lateral temporal grid.  There is an attenuation of the background at 02:26:30 and is most intense in 13, 14, 15.  It is approximately nine seconds in duration and is followed by alpha frequency activity generating out of LL11, 12 and 16, 17.  Behaviorally, the patient lifts her head up as the EEG attenuates.  As fast activity is generated at LL11, 12 and 16, 17, she starts to put her head back down.  Then, as tonic-clonic activity emerges, there is motor activity emerging out at 02:26:48.  She starts to have initially shuffling and then goes on to have tonic-clonic activity.  The tonic-clonic activity is rapid, gradually demonstrating frequency evolution.  The seizure ends at 02:27:51.  In the postictal section, there is some electropositive activity picked up in several of the electrodes and then what may be artifact versus genuine at LL18 and 19 in the postictal section.  The cerebral activity gradually returns, but there seems to be an artifact at 18, 19, which was previously described.  The nurse enters and works with the patient and there is a background of generalized slowing.\\\\nFor this seizure, there were clear clinical signs with the attenuation suggesting either: 1) the immediate change in the EEG produces a change in the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s behavior; or 2) that the seizure was generated from some other region in the brain not captured by the LL grid, as would make sense if it came from the LM grid.\\\\nSEIZURE \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Time 7:47 AM on 7/21/06:  The patient is sleeping.  The seizure is remarkable for an interesting pattern.  There is a change in the EEG at 7:35:22, well before the clear sustained ictal pattern.  There seems to be the appearance of rhythmic sharply contoured delta and paroxysmal slowing that is picked up in the subtemporal strips LM6, 7; 7, 8, and 13, 14 at 7:35:42.  Coincident with this, there is activity with sharply contoured delta in the third strip on the lateral temporal grid, which is LL11, 12 through 14, 15.  This activity also waxes and wanes.  It appears that the delta may be leading forward to generate the seizure.\\\\nThe delta comes and goes in the time samples beforehand, such as 7:48:07 there is spiking seen from the anterior mesial contacts at LL1, 2, with the waxing and waning delta in the second build up of the seizure and spiking in the mesial contact 6, 7.  This pattern is seen prior to the actual seizure itself.\\\\nThe first clear persisting building up into a seizure change is seen in the left lateral temporal grid at 7:49:04, and starts with some spiking at LL13, 14, 15 out of a background that has some spiking with a gradual increase in beta frequency activity.  Of note, there is the beta activity that seems to be building in the frontal region and, with the use of different sensitivities, in the mesial temporal strip.  At 7:49:04, there is a high amplitude activity seen in the third strip, which should correlate to the superior temporal gyrus.  It is high amplitude and, in fact, seems to start in the anterior contacts and then spread to the posterior contacts over time, suggesting that although it seems to be high amplitude posterior using the strip electrodes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 time wise \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 was generated at 11, 12 but is higher voltage at 14, 15. Looking at the strip that is immediately inferiorly in the middle temporal gyrus; again the spikes appear to be demonstrating some degree of time lag.  They are easiest to be seen in the posteriotemporal strips because of the voltage, but actually seem to be generating at LL11, 12.  This activity is clearly defined at LL11, 12, with a generous field of spread to the electrodes immediately posterior and inferior to it.  Reviewing the subtemporal strips, they do demonstrate some spiking, but with the high amplitude spiking it is difficult to see a clear change in them until a chain starts to build up at 7:49:15, which is subtle but there is an unequivocal change in the EEG at 7:49:17 with perhaps 30 seconds of 6 to 8 Hz activity building up before that.  When the change is seen in the subtemporal electrode at 7:49:17, that change is seen in the anterior electrode LM6, 7; 11, 12, and to a lesser extent 18, 19.  At 18, 19, the frequency is 3 to 4 Hz and at 7:49:15, this is probably the identical activity seen in the lateral temporal electrodes, again highest amplitude posterior but occurring first anteriorly in the neocortical region.  At 7:49:19, as the seizure spreads to the mesial temporal electrodes, there is a very intense beta buzz with activity that measures out at more than 20 Hz, although it does appear to be much faster.  On the lateral temporal grid, at 7:49:16, the activity attenuates and there is a burst of lower voltage alpha frequency activity, which is seen with the flattening in the neocortical region and spreading to the subtemporal strip.  As it spreads to the subtemporal strip, there is fast activity, but not without this almost artifactual-looking fast activity coming out of the neocortical strips and then this very intense buzz of activity in the mesial temporal electrodes.  At this point, the activity immediately generalizes throughout the available electrodes, spreading later into the right temporal region.  This activity includes intense paroxysmal activity, most intense in the temporal electrodes, rather than in the frontal regions.  The activity is high amplitude.  It has a triangular appearance in all of the temporal contacts, but has a repetitive alpha frequency activity as it spreads to the right temporal region.  The activity demonstrates paroxysmal spike and wave activity of a tonic-clonic seizure, with gradual frequency evolution over time.  This tonic-clonic pattern is a bit more apparent in the lateral temporal strip and in the subtemporal strip, there is poly spike and slow wave activity with frequency evolution going from theta to delta spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave, which is very high amplitude.  The seizure ends in the left subtemporal strip or the mesial temporal strip at 7:50:50 and on the contralateral strip, ending early at 7:50:37.  Correlating the two at 7:50:27, the activity is most intense and is clearly more sustained with a frequency pattern in the left subtemporal strip, which is the most intense, and is faster frequency in the range of alpha and theta frequency regional spike and slow wave activity.  The activity is extremely high amplitude and using a sensitivity of 300, it is difficult to say where the generator is.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF SEIZURE: At 6:49:39 on the 21st, the patient gently starts to stir.  She is underneath the covers, her arms come up.  She is observed to have dilated pupils.  The nurse enters at 7:49:50.  The patient rolls over on her left side in contrast to the other seizure in which she rolled over to the right.  The nurse holds onto the patient.  Although the back of the patient can be seen, focal shaking of the right arm is identified with tonic-clonic activity.  The second nurse enters to assist.  The focal motor jerking demonstrates frequency evolution starting at faster frequencies evolving to theta frequency activity, gradually slowing at 7:50:23/24.  The seizures ends in the lateral temporal strip with ongoing delta in LL7, 8, 9 and 13, 14, but the patient continues to have tonic-clonic activity with the same high amplitude spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity from the left subtemporal region.  There is some artifact picked up in the subtemporal strips.  The seizure ends in the left subtemporal strip ending at 7:50:50 with profound background suppression and then a pattern of positive discharge at LL8, 9.\\\\nCLINICAL SEIZURE \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Time 17:16: The patient is resting comfortably on her side, and she is drowsy.\\\\nThis EEG can be dictated with the EEG and then the Clinical Correlate.  The seizure begins with a buzz in the mesial electrodes - the most mesial and anterior electrodes of LM6, 7; 11, 12.  In addition, there appears to be a lower voltage buzz in the LM2, 3 contacts, however, that change seems to have slightly different  ______________.  This buzz is accompanied by focal spikes in other electrodes including LL13, 14 and LL19, 20, which would be a bit posterior in the neocortical chain.  There is also a subtle change in LL4, 5, with a bit more irregular theta suggesting a wider area of epileptogenicity.  The alpha/beta buzz activity persists in the subtemporal grid.  It is approximately 15 Hz in frequency, and it demonstrates frequency evolution at 17:17:13.  It becomes a triangular-shaped, 5 Hz sharp wave.  The activity spreads to the lateral temporal chain at 17:17:20, as the patient sits up.  By 17:17:29, the persistent primarily theta frequency activity seen throughout the temporal chain transitions to a spike and slow discharge, building up and spreading laterally throughout the LM chain.  By 17:17:20, the activity clearly involves the two chains from the lateral temporal grid, which overlie the superior and middle temporal gyrus with initially 6 Hz and then faster frequency activity evolving and at 17:17:20, it is clear that this has evolved from a discharge in the subtemporal strip to one that now involves the lateral temporal strip. Coincident with this, the patient sits up and turns her head to the right. There is subtle involvement in the right subtemporal grid at 17:17:35 with clear involvement in the right subtemporal strip at 17:17:37, although that is not sustained.  In addition, this waxes and wanes, re-building again at 17:17:47.  Coincident with the involvement of the right subtemporal strip, is involvement in the left frontal region.  The activity evolves into a fast, generalized spike and slow wave complex, which is very high amplitude.  It starts out as 6 to 7 Hz, and then gradually evolves over time.  It is 4 to 5 Hz at 17:18; 3 Hz at 17:18:37; 2 Hz at 17:18:20.  During this time, the patient demonstrates initially sinus tachycardia with some dysrhythmia.  It ends at 17:18:36 in the lateral temporal grid and at 17:18:40 in the subtemporal grid with profound postictal slowing.  The patient is observed on the telemetry to have persistent tachycardia following a seizure.  She has a long postictal experience and in the times that follow, at 17:31:13, she is still postictal.  The marked background suppression seen at 17:15:23, starts to resolve at 17:15:43.  The activity transitions from a low voltage record to a higher voltage by 17:39.  Curiously, at 17:18:37, the same buzz identified prior to the seizure is seen in the same fashion in the left LM1, 2 electrode.  The patient is resting at that time.  The buzz seems to be a biological and clear entity, with involvement of LM6, 7.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

There is some eye movement artifact picked up and on two occasions, there is a question of underlying sharp waves from the left temporal region with the eye movements.  At the close of hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness, there are discrete, symmetric, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave complexes, some of which have four phases, but none with five phases to meet the poly spike and slow wave criteria.  In some cases, this activity occurs in sleep and seems to almost be followed by spindle activity and/or arousal.  Other features of state II sleep include spindles and abundant POSTS.

This is a 48-hour study.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is in the ICU.  The nurse is working with the technologist. There is a seizure seen at 16:45:48. The patient is not in great focus on the video, but he seems to have subtle jerking of his head with the onset of the activity.  The audio is not working, but reviewing the video, there does seem to be a clinical correlate with jerking of the head when the video can be seen, but for much of the time the tech is talking to someone else, obscuring the patient, and the audio is off so it is not possible to know when the clinical team recognizes the seizure.  The first seizure is three minutes in duration and begins with right frontal sharp and slow wave activity and a repetitive spike pattern.  It lasts three minutes with clear frequency evolution, as well as temporal spread in the right hemisphere.  By 16:46:55, it is involving the left hemisphere.  By 16:47:25, the clinical team may be noting the activity, although it is difficult to tell.  They are moving the electrodes, and reviewing the video it is hard to see the patient moving at that time. The clinical teams moves away from the camera at 16:49 and at that point, the generalized approximately 3 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity pattern is seen with significant muscle and movement artifact maximum on the left, but with clear involvement of the left.  The activity demonstrates a frequency evolution from 5 to 3 Hz and then slowing and ends abruptly with postictal attenuation.  In terms of involvement of the left hemisphere, the occipital region seems to be involved more on the right, more posteriorly than the anterior region.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 16:51:18: The patient is at the bedside and the techs are working with the electrodes.  The seizure again begins with a right frontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave activity.  The initial onset is a little bit more subtle and in this longer discharge, approximately 6.5 minutes, there is little in the way of clinical signs.\\\\nTIME SAMPLES: During this section of the record, there are right frontal sharp and slow wave complexes with a pattern of intrahemispheric asymmetry and disruption of faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere compared to the left.  There is also more arrhythmic delta activity from the right than the left and the phase reversal for much of the epileptiform activity is right frontal, although some is maximum at T4, and there is a generous field of spread at Fp2, F4 for the primary frontal spike. As the recording continues, there is a clear improvement in the background from the left hemisphere with the appearance of more alpha and theta frequency activity.  Over time, the background from the right demonstrates some variability, but in the initial hours following the two seizures, every ten-second epoch demonstrates some sharp waves.  By the early morning hours, the sharp waves on the right are beginning to wane, becoming more subtle in the background, slower amplitude, and transitions from spikes to sharps in terms of duration.  The first 24-hour time sample demonstrates gradual abatement of the sharp waves, which have transitioned to primarily a right frontal sharp wave.\\\\nLong-Term Monitoring, September 9, 2006 to September 10, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The recording on 09/09 demonstrates gradual diminution, a fading of the epileptiform activity from the right frontal region.  The overall background from the left demonstrates some variability with some portions being much slower than the right.

Patient is confused. She is intermittently agitated.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF RECORD: \\\\tThe background EEG is markedly high amplitude. As the recording begins, there is a homogeneous, high amplitude pattern with a 2 Hz periodic complex. The activity can be reviewed as a sensitivity of 10 at which point activity is maximum in the right hemisphere. It is present bilaterally, but is clearly maximum in the right in the posterior regions and has fast activity superimposed upon it. With the use of an average reference, despite some artifacts, the activity is clearly maximum in the right occipital electrode and is high amplitude, requires a sensitivity of 20 and has a periodicity of 2 to 3.5\\\\nHz. Using the average reference, the activity is also seen at T6. The activity is actually electropositive at 0.2 rather than electronegative but with a typical after going slow waves in that region. Positivity suggesting that there could be a horizontal dipole is picked up with a lower amplitude activity seen in the referential at S7, ST1 suggesting that while referential montage produces a clear idea of a voltage dependency, the activity could actually be faulty localized or has a transverse dipole. This activity is seen at the onset of the EEG at 11:39 and drops out abruptly at 11:43:19. As it does\\\\nso, there is a pattern of theta frequency activity. The activity recurs again while the patient is somewhat just after 11:44 but there is muscle artifact. It is clearly seen to be developing at\\\\n11:45:00. The 11:45:00 captures the onset of a seizure with staring and faster amplitude much higher activity as was seen initially with the electropositivity at 02 a little bit but not much electronegativity in the frontal region. Reviewing this\\\\nseizure with a referential montage again, this activity seems to begin with fast activity seen at 11:44:31. That activity seems\\\\nto be excluded in the occipital regions and there can be seen to be frequency evolution. Again an abrupt drop out is noted with a theta pattern at 11:44:51. The seizures can be reviewed with multiple different montages. By the end, it is clear that there is a high amplitude more generalized bursts maximum in the occipital regions, left or right occipital, likely right\\\\nalthough the amplitude is slightly higher at 01 than at 02. This is followed by the patient pursing her lips and staring slightly to the left. Seizure duration is variable and ranges from 2-3 minutes to one which is as long as 9 minutes but is typically in the 3-minute section. Some automatic behavior is possible during the seizures. For example, the nurse checks the patient\\'s temperature during the EEG and does not seem to be aware that\\\\nthe patient is having a seizure.\\\\nHR:\\\\t96 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: \\\\tAbnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

The accurate localization was somewhat challenging and there were some atypical features such as a high amplitude but positive rather than negative discharge using the referential montage.

The patient\\'s medications are modified during this record.\\\\nOn day 1, May 23 to May 24, 2008, medications Depakote followed by Midazolam.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern with frequent sharp waves and bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity. The generalized paroxysmal fast activity is approximately is approximate 1 second long. Over the course of the record, with the use of Midazolam drip, the activity becomes a bit more suppressed, but does not reach a burst suppression pattern.\\\\nDate May 24, 2008 to May 25, 2008: During this portion of the record, the patient remains in Midazolam drip. The EEG is a bit higher amplitude. I remains somewhat discontinuous with paroxysmal fast activity. At 10:10, the Midazolam drip is increased to\\\\n7. Over the course of the day, the midazolam drip is increased to 7. This produces a more suppressed pattern.\\\\nMay 25, 2008 to May 26, 2008: During this section of the record, the patient is on the Midazolam drip which is titrated upward from 7. The patient has received Keppra 1500 mg per day for approximately 24 hours without much in the way of improvement. There are portions of the record, however, where there periodic sharp waves and the fast activity are abating in a lower voltage pattern can be noted. Much of the record shows continuous, post anoxic pattern with theta and a discontinuous pattern, but there are brief portions without this.\\\\nMay 25, 2008 through May 26, 2008: No additional comments are observed in this section of the record. No additional information is provided regarding the use of medications at that time.\\\\nMay 26, 2008 to May 27, 2008: The video camera is obscured during portions of this record. The electrode quality is poor. No clinical comments or information regarding the patient\\'s medication is available, but there does seem to be eye movement. Some portions of the record continue to show the paroxysmal fast activity and sharp activity, but others show portions of the record with little in the way of this activity.\\\\nMonday, May 26, 2008 to May 27, 2008: No clinical comments accompany this section of the data. Electrode integrity is increasingly lost. Medications in this section of the record are unknown. Despite the serious problems in electrode quality the EEG at this section continues to show a discontinuous pattern with paroxysmal fast activity.\\\\nMay 27, 2008 to May 28, 2008: No information is provided regarding patient\\'s medications or clinical examination.\\\\nBackground EEG demonstrates intermittent paroxysmal fast activity and an intermittently discontinuous record in this record which continues to demonstrate suboptimal electrode quality, there are portions of the record that are a bit more continuous.Other portions of the record are obscured by other artifacts and there seem to be some sort of an electrical artifact seen periodically in the record which may include and antithrombotic pump.\\\\nHR:\\\\t104 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nReplacement of normal background with a markedly abnormal pattern which at least initially is compatible with a late anoxic status epilepticus type of pattern with generalized sharp activity and periodic fast activity.\\\\nLack of good quality EEG data in the last 72 hours of the recording and the absence of historical information limit precluding an assessment as to whether or not this patient\\'s status epilepticus has resolved.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION :  Compatible with severe, anoxic encephalopathy.\\\\nAdditional testing and historical information may resolve the problems described above.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

It is present in the\\\\nfrontal regions bilaterally. The clinical correlates, described by bedside examiners,\\\\ninclude ocular twitching.\\\\nThe amplitude of the frontal spike and slow wave, and sharp and slow wave complexes\\\\nranges between 50 and 100 microvolts. In addition, there is some frontal fast activity.\\\\nThe patient is clinically hyperventilating at this time. The frontal, ictal activity\\\\ndemonstrates a beta frequency evolution, typically transitioning into activity that is faster\\\\nthan 4 Hz and is associated with frontal fast activity.\\\\nThe Ativan clearly produces a dramatic attenuation of the epileptiform activity and the\\\\nrecord transitions to a lower voltage theta pattern.

The patient appears to be having seizure activity throughout the record which is predominantly on the right side. There are multiple seizure patterns within this record. At some points there are spike patterns that are appreciated, predominantly in the right frontal area. Another pattern is an 8 Hz ictal alpha rhythm which includes some sharp waves and a third of them is right periodic sharp activity .\\\\nAt about 3:27:37 there is 1 episode where there is an increase in the right sided frequency, which is followed by bilateral alpha, which is then buried by tonic clonic muscle activity. This muscle activity involves a very distinct frequency evulsion that is distinctive for true tonic clonic seizure.  Followed by this activity there is delta activity bilaterally which then ends first on the left side, followed by the right side before returning to baseline. This episode is correlated on the video EEG by initially left head turning, followed by shaking of the left arm and leg, followed by the right arm, which then he assumes a figure-of-four position.  Throughout the record there is also some facial twitch appreciated on the video.\\\\nHR:  100 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nMultiple epileptiform features that presents in 4 distinct patterns.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the epileptiform features that are noted both in this EEG, as well as the clinical correlation and on video, this patient will require higher dose modification of his current anti-seizure medications for better control of his epileptiform activity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

There is focal delta in the right frontal central region with a right frontal spike or sharp wave. There is also some muscle artifact in the same region. Spontaneous arouses are associated with an increase in beta. There is also intermittent subtle discontinuity. Other features of arousal include eye movement. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an arousal response with eye opening and increase in faster frequency activity. An episode of mouth twitching is observed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to have the level of detail on the video to see this on the video, but the mouth twitching does seem characterized by muscle artifact particularly on the right. The mouth twitching occurs after the EEG technician stimulated the patient.\\\\nHR: 116 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes a 10 Hz 40 mV alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In wakefulness, accentuated in hyperventilation and in drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic, 3 to\\\\n4 Hz, bilateral temporal slowing.  This may be rhythmic, irregular and is typically maximum\\\\nanterior temporal regions.  Mixed in with this are occasional right anterior temporal sharp waves and some which are right posterior temporal.  Alerting of the patient seems to decrease this activity.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the sharp waves on the right. Hyperventilation also produces FIRDA some of which is notched, but during the hyperventilation response, there is no definitive spike and wave activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, as well as an increase in the bursts described above, but sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits minimal bilateral driving.\\\\nHR:\\\\t72 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.\\\\tUnusual bursts of unilateral or bilateral rhythmic temporal slowing with a right posterior temporal sharp wave.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:   The findings described in the hyperventilation response, include some normal and some potentially pathologic findings as well.

No clinical information is provided.  The technologist had difficulty with the patient\\'s electrode placement due to matted hair.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern, intermittently discontinuance.  There is no mention that medications have been changed prior to the baseline, but in contrast to the initial recording, which demonstrated a prominent sharp wave at the vertex, these are not quite as prominent and do seem to have an usual spread starting a little bit at the right and moving towards the left.  There are portions of the record, however, where the activity seems to build up and when it does there is a right frontal discharge.  The discharge in the right frontal region does not correlate exactly with the discharge of Cz, suggesting a complex ictal pattern.  This brief ictal discharge is seen at 18:08:32 and is not associated with a clinical change in the patient\\'s behavior.  There are no additional notes in the record, but intermittently, this activity is seen right frontal and CZ/C4, but it is more fragmented, although clearly some sharp waves can be observed in association with this.  Over the course of the recording the overall background is somewhat slower.\\\\n\\\\nNo additional notes or maneuvers are demonstrated in this digital video EEG.  There is some brief bursts of fast activity observed at 4:00a.m.\\\\n\\\\nHR:  60 bpm\\\\n\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. \\\\tA complex electrographic seizure from the right hemisphere with 2 different frequencies of epileptiform activity.\\\\n2. \\\\tRight frontal and CZ/C4 epileptiform activity.\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring session identified 1 seizure.

There is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm observed. As the tracing again, the patient is awake with a 9.5 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominate rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by\\\\nslow-rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation is initiated early in the record, at 13:30 the patient is in the middle of hyperventilation.  At this time, 13:30:50 there is an arousal.   This is followed by the appearance of beta at 13:30:55, with repetitive sharp activity and theta maximum in the left temporal region, but with some bilateral representation.  As this continues at 13:31:07, there is little in the way of clinical manifestations.  By 13:31:10, the patient is starting to look from side to side.  He looks somewhat startled or frightened.

He seems to be having automatic movements, face and but the audio is not\\\\ndiscernable.  The EEG goes on to be obscured with muscle.  As the patient\\'s behaviors change, at 13:31:44, as he does that he has had head turning to the right. He gets up, he rotating around and looking all the way to the right.  He starts to turn around and around and he puts his head down. At that point, he rolls back towards his back and he has tonic clonic activity with his back to the camera with tonic stiffening and then clonic by 13:32:05. he seems to be having tonic clonic activity in the right arm but the left arm is stiff. Foaming at the mouth is seen at 13:32:19.  while he has eye deviation to the left he is jerking primarily with the right arm.  The characteristic slow pattern at the close of the clonic tonic seizure as the motor activity slows, is observed at 13:32:39. This seizure  ends at 13:32:48.  This is a 2 minute seizure.  Afterwards, the patient is awake, but agitated and he starts to get up and move about. There is a caregiver present with the technologist who applies oxygen.

There is a discernible 9Hz 50 microvolt alpha rhythm on the right which is disrupted on the left.  In addition, there is a skull defect with head rocking in the right central region and overall disruption of mu activity on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include a drop out of faster frequency activity which occurs on the right much sooner on the left.\\\\nA seizure occurs at 09:53:03.

When he is not seizing his body is turned slightly to the left. He seems to be overbreathing  or gasping with the ventilator.

The patient is very confused during the test. As the tracing begins, the patient is at the bedside. He is staring off into space. He uses his right hand, but never moves his left. The patient is somewhat responsive.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG starts out somewhat poorly organized with generous beta. In addition, the overall background includes theta and alpha frequency activity. There are some frontal temporal sharp waves noted at F4 C4 initially.\\\\n\\\\nThere is arrhythmic noncontinuous delta beginning to emerge at 12:15. This becomes increasingly rhythmic at 12:16. This wanes on its own, but when it recurs during the EEG the patient lifts up his right hand and seems to have difficulty putting down the right hand. The technologist moves the patient around a bit and at 12:26 the activity seems to be fading. In addition to some artifact there is a question of T6 sharp waves.\\\\n\\\\nThe second seizure is observed in the EEG at 12:21, but there is little in the way of a clinical correlate aside from a confused patient. The technologist notes that the patient is not able to follow commands such as keeping his eyes closed, but there is clearly a rhythmic ictal discharge lasting approximately 2 seconds with postictal slowing and then spikes which can be T2, T4, C4. The second seizure as it fades seems to generate into a third seizure at 12:26. Again, the rhythmic theta frequency activity waxes and wanes. With the second seizure it does not seem to be ending. It is ongoing at 12:30:20. Spikes start to appear more frequently in the seizures in comparison to the first sections of the record in which it was primarily a pattern of rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is agitated during the EEG and receives Ativan.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background is a bit slow. When the patient becomes agitated, he wakes up and there is a prominent 12 hertz alpha rhythm noted bilaterally. Approximately 10 seconds into the arousal state with the bilateral alpha as the patient becomes agitated, more rhythmic 4-5 hertz activity emerges from the left central and parietal regions. The behavior of the patient is difficult to observe because the caregiver is trying to restrain the patient. The patient is described as agitated and poorly responsive by the caregiver during the seizure. He seems to have looked to his right during the seizure although the caregiver approaches from the left obscuring the view. A second seizure occurs and again is characterized by first a somewhat slow background and then in this case at 16:56:05, a burst of bilateral fast activity following the appearance of the theta on the left at 16:56:11 and then as this occurs, there is more fast activity bilaterally, more clear evidence of a breach with higher amplitude fast activity more so on the left than the right and then more definitive frequency evolution is noted at 16:57:11 as the patient postures through to the right with head turning to the right and what seems like a decorticate or dystonic posturing of the right hand more so than the left. He also has some irregular respirations and then some clonic activity. There is a problem with the EEG and the EEG stops recording although the video continues through the end of the seizure.

The most prominent features in this record are high amplitude sharp wave spike or polyspike maximum in the right posterior quadrant with some variability, sometimes P4 or 02 maximum, sometimes T6. In addition, recurrent seizures are characterized by rhythmic repetitive theta frequency activity and repetitive spike activity with frequency evolution. The seizures terminate abruptly.

Status epilepticus with a pattern maximum in the right posterior temporal region.\\\\nLONG TERM MONITORING 11/24-28/2010 EEG LTM 10-135\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage slow pattern on the left. The right hemisphere has bursts of polyspike activity from the right central and parietal region. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. In the initial section of the record at 4:06, the bursts continue to build up, wax and wane. By 5:01 p.m., interestingly, the EEG is more continuous and the bursts are disappearing. By 6:41, the EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern. Despite the use of a Versed drip over the course of the night, intermittent rhythmic seizures are observed typically in the right central parietal region. The EEG also varies a bit in terms of a burst suppression pattern or a more continuous pattern but the seizures do occur out of the burst suppression pattern. The Versed is titrated up to a dose of 7 mg. By 4 a.m., the seizures are not sustained. At 7:56 a.m., the EEG is increasingly continuous. The well-defined seizures are not identified but bursts of activity are identified out of the right. There is a fair amount of variability in the background ranging from a more continuous pattern to a burst suppression pattern and then this ongoing highly epileptogenic pattern from the right hemisphere.\\\\nFrom 11/25/2010 to 11/26/2010: The patient remains on a Versed drip. The video is not available. The overall background includes a relatively suppressed or intermittent burst suppression pattern. The well-defined seizures noted originally were not noted in this epoch of the record. At the end of this section of the record, bursts of activity up to 7 seconds with epileptiform activity in the right central and parietal regions are noted but the epileptiform activity is not as high amplitude as previously.\\\\nLater sections on 11/25/2010, demonstrate a more continuous pattern with right occipital and parietal occipital spiking and polyspike activity. The record is quite variable with some sections clearly showing the same burst suppression pattern seen previously. No clinical seizures are noted and the seizure and spike detection identifies the burst suppression with parietal or posterior spikes but no sustained seizures.\\\\nOn 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: This section of the record demonstrates a pattern that is not always burst suppression. There are bursts of activity always with a spike in the right posterior region. There are no sustained or clinical or electrographic seizures, although when there are bursts of activity that are longer than 3 seconds in duration, it appears as if the patient is likely to seize. The seizure and spike detector captures the majority of the epileptiform activity.\\\\nBy 8:29 on 1112712010, the epileptiform activity is no longer occurring in bursts and it has transitioned to more of a periodic pattern.\\\\nOn 11/27/2010 to 11/28/2010: This section of the record demonstrates frequent occipital or occipital parietal spikes. The background ranges from a burst suppression pattern to more of a continuous low voltage theta pattern. On some occasions, the bursts of sharp waves appear in brief trains.\\\\nHR: 120bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to:\\\\n1. Electrographic seizures noted in the first 24 hours of the record from the central parietal and posterior temporal regions.\\\\n2. Burst suppression pattern.\\\\n3. Bursts of epileptiform activity in the right posterior quadrant.\\\\n4. Some periodic sharp waves.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right posterior quadrant. Although no additional seizures were recorded, if the patient is still receiving a Versed or sedative hypnotic drip, that might explain the discontinuous pattern. If this patient is no longer receiving anesthetic levels of sedation, additional evaluation for global cerebral function is suggested.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

The patient is intubated, eyes open and somewhat responsive. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is a theta pattern. Superimposed on the theta pattern is a high amplitude bilateral periodic complex. The complex is clearly present bilaterally particularly in the frontotemporal regions but it is more prominent on the left. The epileptiform activity in this record is complex and not all of the discharges are identical. Some are a little more remarkable at the midline in the frontocentral regions and others a bit more on the left and some more clearly have a posterior morphology. The epileptiform activity is superimposed over what is primarily a theta frequency pattern. With the switch to high sensitivity of 10 to 15, the activity is more clearly posterior temporally predominant but generally speaking it is bilateral and generalized. There is a preponderance of the generalized discharges again more posteriorly predominant over the focal discharges. There are some sections of the record where the activity seems to build up and in doing so, there is also an increase in rhythmic 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity followed by brief attenuations. Those discharges are associated with eye blinking and are compatible with an ictal or seizure pattern. In addition to the observation of eye blinking, there is a little bit of movement in the right hand.\\\\n\\\\nStimulation of the patient produces a gagging response but no real alerting. Ativan is administered and immediately attenuates the epileptiform activity.

The patient is unresponsive. He\\\\nis examined throughout the EEG. A clinical seizure with myoclonus is noted.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and\\\\nincludes initially a medium amplitude mixed frequency pattern with some rhythmic theta\\\\nand delta from both hemispheres. The major abnormalities in this record include a left\\\\noccipital periodic sharp wave which clearly evolves during the record. In addition, there\\\\nis rhythmic theta delta from the left mid temporal region with a generous field of spread\\\\nwhich does not always have the same periodicity as the left occipital sharp wave.\\\\nA clinical seizure is noted at 08:49:20 characterized by the appearance of right-sided\\\\n\"myoclonic jerking.\" This is associated with an increase in faster frequency activities\\\\nfrom the left. This is seen at 08:49:10 and is in fact beta frequency activity which is so\\\\nrhythmic that it almost appears to be artifactual and is approximately 15 Hz. The total\\\\nseizure duration is 2 minutes. Muscle artifact obscures the epileptiform pattern but this\\\\nis likely a pattern of fast activity from the left central region. The postictal record is\\\\nmarkedly suppressed followed by some lower voltage rhythmic activity at C3P3.

There is intermittent 6-7 Hz activity in the occipital regions, a bit more prominent from the left compared to the right. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and also seems to elicit an asymmetric hyperventilation response of a bit more rhythmic slower mixed theta delta on the left compared to the right.\\\\nThe patient reports seeing something during the EEG.  This is associated with an electrographic discharge in the left occipital region at T5, O1, and P3.  Movement, repetitive 6 Hz activity is noted in the left posterior quadrant.  It starts at brief bursts of activity lasting a few seconds and then a more sustained burst with frequency evolution is noted at 9:10:26.  That more sustained bursts demonstrates frequency evolution, slowing, and beginning to disappear by 9:11:26.  The patient is able to recall a code word given during the ictal discharge at 9:10:48.

The EEG begins with the patient somnolent following Ativan.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient appears quite ill. His overall background is very low voltage and featureless. Intermittently, he has elevation and jerking of his right arm. He is examined and does not withdraw to noxious stimulation. The initial seizures are characterized by artifact with repetitive alpha and beta muscle artifact noted on the right. As the EEG continues, however, including at 16:14:20, as the seizure ends, there is a clear pattern of rhythmic 5 to 7 Hz activity on the left, which follows the motor activity on the right. The motor activity typically lasts approximately 30 seconds It obscures the EEG, but it slows with a characteristic Ictal pattern and, interestingly, although the start of the seizure is abrupt and does not particularly demonstrate a clear scalp EEG pattern, the end of the seizure has characteristic frequency evolution With the sharp waves defined on the left as the muscle artifact wanes With each seizure, he is looking to the right, jerks the right arm and is poorly responsive In the end of the seizure at 16:22.41, the slow ictal jerking on the right is clearly associated with sharp waves in the left hemisphere, which include left frontocentral and central temporal.\\\\nTwo mg of Ativan are given at 16:29.\\\\nHeart rate 60 BPM\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a focal status epilepticus.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an unresponsive patient with focal epileptiform activity and a severely suppressed pattern.

This EEG was Initiated on the evening of the 10th following repetitive complex partial seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Day #1, September 10 to September 11, 2010: This initial section demonstrates, particularly in the early evening, repetitive complex partial seizures from the right temporal region with characteristic evolution of rhythmic theta frequency activity and sharp waves. In the steep recording, the seizures abate but the next morning they are seen intermittently, particularly at 9:00 a.m. They last 1 to 2 minutes. They seem to decrease as the patient drifts off to sleep. The patient is out of status epilepticus throughout much of the morning but between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. she does experience relatively frequent complex partial seizures. Stimulation of the patient at 10:15 produces an arousal but no additional seizures.\\\\nDay #2, September 11 to September 12, 2010: This section of the record begins shortly after 10:00 am. Seizures typically lasting approximately 1 minute are identified but are not continuous. There are significant sections of the record without seizures. The patient received additional doses of carbamazepine and phenobarbital. Complex partial seizure out of sleep characterized by faster frequency activity in the beta frequency range is noted at 3:29a.m., and this seizure localizes a bit more to the patients structural abnormality in the posterior temporal and the cortical area. This section of the EEG is terminated at 14:45, when the patient goes to MRI scan, but the seizures have not abated and she continues to have complex partial seizures at 14:42. While there is waxing and waning of the overall seizure frequency, at that section of the record, her seizures are more frequent and, in fact, are frequent enough to meet the criteria for complex partial status epilepticus.\\\\nLONG TERM MONITORING 01/13/2010 to 09/16/2010\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

Most seizures are on the order of 1 to 2 minutes in duration.   Some, but not all, seizures are clinically significant and are associated with head turning to the left and confusion. At least in the ear1y section of the record, the patient has a mild left hemiparesis. She demonstrates persistent left HOMONYMOUS hemianopsia and transient left sided weakness.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.   There are frequent left anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes identified in wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity, as well as accentuating rhythmic, somewhat sharply contoured 3 to 5 Hz activity seen from the left temporal region.   The patient reports no clinical symptoms with the ongoing rhythmic slowing maximum at T1, but with involvement of F7.   During HV, there are occasional bursts of hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Following HV, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in amplitude of the background followed by the appearance of vertex waves and occasional spindles.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not clearly activate the record.\\\\nHR:  72BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

There are practice push buttons, but buttons are never pressed for any of the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seizures.  Complicating interpretation of this record is the problem that the patient receives multiple different pulmonary therapies, all of which have some sort of cyclic mechanism producing huge amounts of artifact in the EEG, which is interpreted by the spike detector as a seizure.\\\\nThere is a report that seizures occurred, but unfortunately these are not documented.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal, low voltage, and relatively featureless.  There are occasional sharp waves.  Sleep/wake cycles are difficult to define.\\\\nSEIZURE: DATE 10/20/04, TIME 20:07:08: The patient is in the room with the nurse.  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern.  The patient is motionless.  At 20:07:14, the left arm rises and begins to jerk.  The right arm follows at 20:07:16.  Both arms are elevated.  There is almost a fluttering, but there is tonic posturing of the extremities.  The EEG is almost completely obscured by muscle artifact, which is beta frequency.  By 20:07:38, however, characteristic paroxysmal frequency evolution can be identified and the activity transitions to more of a theta, 5 to 7 Hz pattern.  The patient gags at 20:07:43 and the right hand is motionless and the left hand shaking.  This shows classic clonic slowing.  The patient has vocalizations.  Her ventilator monitor triggers at 20:07:53 and the seizure is essentially over at 20:07:53.  After the seizure, there seems to be attenuation of the activity from the right hemisphere and ongoing fast activity from the left hemisphere.  The child has eye opening at 20:11.  At this time, there is some asymmetry with an ongoing pattern of overall suppression from the right.\\\\nSEIZURE: DATE 10/21/04, TIME 08:59:28: The patient is in her room.  She doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move, but occasionally there is eye movement.  Within four seconds a very subtle change in the EEG is seen and the child has some high amplitude eye opening and eye closure.  There is very subtle activity seen for 4 or 5 seconds in the right centroparietal region with low voltage theta and then more clearly defined 5 Hz theta from the right parietal occipital region.  This goes on to demonstrate frequency evolution with increasing intensity of fast activity and some underlying delta in the same region.  At 08:59:50, the child has very subtle movements of the left arm, which disappears by 08:59:56.  There is just a brief tremor in the left arm.  The EEG changes described initially have disappeared by 09:00:12, but there is some subtle delta picked up in the right parietal/occipital region, as well as some focal sharp waves picked up at T4/T6, gradually building up at 09:00:32.  By 09:02, the EEG has returned to its baseline and unfortunately there is EKG artifact in both temporal regions.\\\\nBoth of the above seizures seem to be emanating from the right hemisphere.\\\\nHR:  120 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal 48-hour video EEG due to:\\\\nMarkedly abnormal background with paucity of normal wave forms for an individual of this age.\\\\nSharp waves identified from the left anterior temporal region.\\\\nA single seizure identified.  Although there is a significant amount of muscle movement artifact seen at the beginning of the EEG, the behavior involved the left arm and there was clear focal slowing from the right.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional seizures likely occurred in this 48-hour monitoring, however, due to the use of mechanical devices, which produced artifact as well as the failure to push the button, it is not possible to identify these.  Additional recording with a push button for each and every behavior is necessary to adequately quantify and characterize this patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seizures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

As the EEG starts, the patient has just had a seizure.  The patient has an additional seizure during the EEG while the study is recording.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the EEG includes a fair amount of muscle.  Despite this, there is a breach rhythm from the left frontal region with generous beta activity as well as rhythmic theta.  The activity from the right hemisphere is lower voltage with generous fast activity.  The second seizure in this EEG is preceded by several minutes of rhythmic theta frequency activity from the left frontal region including F7, F3, and C3. There are occasional F7 or F3 sharp waves.   The seizure begins at 14:10:50.  The patient has tremulousness of his head.  The tech is uncertain as to what the event is and calls the patient at 14:11:28.  At 14:11:18, the patient starts to have head deviation to the right.  The EEG is partially obscured by movement, but underneath this, rhythmic 3 Hz delta activity can be identified in the background with frequency evolution in terms of gradual slowing from approximately 3.5 Hz to then 2 Hz.  The patient looks to the right, which is away from the camera, and by 14:12:37, his right arm elevates and he looks at the tech.  He is unable to respond to questions at 14:12:47.  By 14:13:40, he can start to answer questions including his name.  In the interim, there is a partial resolution of the rhythmic theta activity from the left frontotemporal region.  By 14:14:01, the rhythmic left frontotemporal theta is starting to reappear.\\\\nNo additional seizures are recorded.\\\\nHR:  78 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nTwo seizures within a 30-minute EEG, both of which are complex partial and both of which occurred in the context of a patient who is failing to return to baseline mental status, compatible with the diagnosis of complex partial status epilepticus.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

There are some technical problems with the review of the EEG, although all data appears to be present.\\\\nEVENTS:  Push button events with clear correlates include 01:25:38, 9:11 AM, 10:26 and 10:33 all on the morning of the 28th.\\\\nThe epileptiform discharges are generally 20 to 40 seconds in duration.  For the spells that the patient describes as mild seizures, there is a subtle increase in the left temporal theta.  For those spells that she describes as more clear seizures including the one at 10:26, the patient has motion arrest, her head drops, and she is not as verbally responsive.  During these seizures, there is repetitive spike and slow wave activity from the left temporal region, maximum at T1 with frequency evolution.  At the close of two of the seizures on the morning of the 28th, there is return of the alpha rhythm from the posterior head regions before the seizure has concluded.  Using an average reference, it looks as if the right hemisphere has return of the alpha before the left, but in other montages, this is not as apparent.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 23:37:25 on the 27th:  There is the initial subtle appearance of rhythmic 5 Hz theta from the left temporal region followed by high amplitude sharply contoured 4 to 5 Hz activity, almost with a double phase reversal, followed by muscle at 23:47:50, which obscures the end of the seizure.  In the seconds that follow, there is some excess theta from the left temporal region.  The patient is able to push the button at precisely the start of the seizure.  She sits up.  She moves her face off camera, and her head appears to be slightly tremulous.  There is a small degree of head bobbing at 23:37:50.  This occurs as the computer alarm goes off.  The seizure appears to be over at 23:38.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The patient does not appear to sleep much throughout the night.

In this individual with a previous craniotomy, there is a fair amount of beta activity and a very sharply contoured background from the right hemisphere.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  The focal slowing from the right is not so significantly accentuated by sleep.\\\\nOn 1/20/06, the patient reports no spells during this section of the record.  There are practice push buttons at 9:31, 19:47, and there is another push button not recorded by the patient at 19:47 when he seems to be reading, and at 24:24:20.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This portion of the EEG is remarkable for a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact, particularly when the patient is awake.  In stage II sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles, as well as rare, right temporal sharp waves.  Focal slowing is seen from the right hemisphere with a sharply contoured background in the right hemisphere.  Abundant beta spindles are noted.  The record is very sharply contoured, but there are no definite epileptiform discharges from the right, although there is some sharply contoured slowing occasionally at T4/C4.  Deeper stages of sleep are difficult to identify.\\\\nHR:\\\\t70 to 80 BPM.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, January 21, 2006 to January 22, 2006\\\\nINTRODUCTION: The patient experiences the bulk of his symptoms during this time frame.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has multiple episodes with left-sided shaking.  He is able to push the button for all of them.  They occur at 2:00 PM, 2:54, 3:27, 4:38, 11:45, 12:15 AM, 8:15 AM on the 22nd, 2:10 PM, and carrying over to 5:00 PM, 7:20, and 7:50.  These may have been previously reported in the previous section.  The average duration is five minutes, but some are six to seven minutes, and a single spell is 14 minutes.  The video is reviewed for these, and the patient remains awake and alert for all of them.  He presses the button for the majority of them.  He reports feeling unwell before they happen.  He has left-sided twitching.  He sometimes puts something in his mouth, which he takes in and out of his mouth.  He has left-sided tremulousness and at times a sense of generalized tremulousness.  Of note, in many of these, his heart rate increases to 140 or 150 BPM; in some cases, prior to the seizure, the heart rate increases to 100 BPM.  Because of the increase in heart rate, the telemetry monitor is triggered.  The patient reports that he feels that his heart is beating very fast and asks two people to hold him.  On each occasion, he is tested by the nurse and he remembers a code word.  On some occasions, he is given 4 mg of Valium, which does tend to abbreviate the spells.  The nurses check his vital signs: pulse/ox 99%; temp 97.\\\\nThe multiple spells are reviewed.  There is no clear EEG correlate for any of the spells.  There is no real change in the background focal slowing.  The motor activity does not have a characteristic paroxysmal frequency evolution, and the most prominent feature is the sinus tachycardia, which occurs with each spell.  There is muscle artifact.  There is also 5 Hz rocking artifact with the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s movements, but no underlying paroxysmal frequency evolution with the spells.  In some cases, with the degree of artifact, the overall EEG becomes difficult to interpret, but with the use of filters and sometimes eliminating a bad electrode, it is much clearer that this is entirely rocking artifact.  In addition, on some occasions when the patient stops rocking, a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm can be identified.  In addition, there is no postictal slowing when the patient is comfortable.  Of note, the heart rate changes occur early in these symptomatologies.\\\\nBecause of some of the electrode problems, the use of a double banana montage at times is more valuable than some of the specific temporal montages.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, January 22, 2006 to January 23, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Depakote.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: During this 24-hour section of the record, the patient had three episodes at 5:00 PM and at 7:27:50 PM when he experienced tachycardia and left-sided twitching.  He describes this sometimes as mild twitching.  He was able to answer questions and follow commands for all events.\\\\nEVENT TIME 17:06: The patient is sitting up in bed.  The EEG demonstrates some focal slowing particularly from the temporal regions.  This EEG is remarkable for some single channel movement artifact, but no definite change in the EEG.  The patient feels tremulous.  As is the case for some of the previous seizures, he puts something in his mouth.  Single channel artifact is picked up at C4-F4.  He sits up at 7:10:34.  This event is remarkable compared to others in that he does not experience tachycardia.  He does put a cloth in his mouth during this event.\\\\nEVENT TIME 7:28: The patient reports two minutes of mild left-sided twitching.  At 19:48, the patient is lying in bed on his side.  The EEG demonstrates focal slowing from the right temporal and right centrotemporal regions with a generous field of spread. His heart rate is in the 70s.  At 19:48, he sits up.  He had been lying on his side with a cloth in his mouth and then as he sits up, he again experiences a tachycardia with a heart rate in the 140s.  By 19:50:40, the heart rate is beginning to slow down.\\\\nEVENT TIME 19:58: The patient is lying on his side.  He reports feeling tremulous and tremor artifact is picked up.  The background EEG does not clearly identify a change, but unfortunately, there is so much artifact it is difficult to know.  It doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t appear that he has testing, but he does seem to have had tachycardia that persists through 20:02:08 while he is resting comfortably.  At that time, no other clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The baseline interictal focal slowing from the right hemisphere is identified, however.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The sleep recording is compromised by some problems with electrode integrity and EKG artifact.  Vertex waves and spindles are identifiable.

Features that speak against an underlying epileptiform nature include the presence of an alpha rhythm seen when the spells can be briefly attenuated, the marked prolongation of the spells, which are much longer than one might typically expect for seizures, and the waxing and waning nature of the motor activity.  The possibility that these spells are a reaction to the palpitations must be considered.

       " 'b\"INTRODUCTION: Long-term video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard\\\\n10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no clinical seizures noted by the team.  There are test push button events.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG demonstrates some portions of  the record with prolonged focal slowing from the left temporal region with sharp waves and spikes.   In sleep, there is frontal delta and occasional vertex waves.  The overall background is slow from both hemispheres, particularly from the left temporal region.   Review of the Stellate detections identifies primarily left temporal, irregular, high amplitude focal slowing and sharp waves.\\\\nRare spikes from the right hemisphere are seen.\\\\nSubclinical seizures are seen at 12:13 and 12:54. The patient is asleep, lying on one side.  Trains of high amplitude, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity are identified. The onset is relatively clear at 12:54, but the off set is a bit more complicated although it is clearly over by\\\\n12:59 AM. A similar discharge is noted at 00:16:44.\\\\nStage II sleep is characterized by spindles and can be seen at 4:24 AM.  The focal epileptiform activity is again seen at this time.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, March 1, 2006 to March 2, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Valproate, and others.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard\\\\n10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with one channel  of EKG. Practice  push buttons were recorded, but no clinical seizures were observed by the patient or caregivers.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The seizure file demonstrates intermittent, prolonged bursts of spike and slow wave and focal slowing from the left.  In some cases, these are on the order of minutes, but there is no clear postictal slowing or off set, although there are also portions where this activity has disappeared.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  The waking record at times demonstrates rhythmic background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern and at other times there are left temporal sharp waves or spikes.\\\\nPhiladelphia, PA 19140\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, 111arch 2, 2006 to March 3,  2006\\\\nSEIZURE TIME- 16:08: The patient is in bed, lying on his left side. He had some occasional automatisms.  In contrast to previous sections of the record, there seems to be an initially 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  There is a fair amount of background muscle artifact and the EEG is best reviewed with both a 60Hz and 35Hz filter. It is noted that at 16:05, the patient seems to be awake, but he is in his usual state of delta. He  has some spontaneous movements, which would suggest that the presence of the 8 to 9 Hz  alpha frequency activity is actually pathologic in this patient.  Because the first changes actually resemble normal cerebral activity, it is a bit difficult to be entirely certain where the seizure begins. At 16:06, the background slowing is noted  from the right, but the left seems to be a bit more attenuated.\\\\tAt 16:07, there are rhythmic, repetitive sharp waves from the left.  This is a more prolonged discharge and has some evidence for frequency evolution. The alpha frequency activity appears at 16:07:47.  During this time, there are no clear clinical correlates for this event. However,  at  16:08:17, the activity that looks like normal alpha activity is likely pathologic in this individual.  At 16:08:28, the right and movements are  identified. \\\\tThey  are  initially  non-specific,  but then are somewhat  repetitive. They do produce some artifact, surprisingly more so than one would expect.   The repetitive circular movements continue.   They are at times almost slow and intermittent  and at 16:08:46, there is a background of alpha frequency activity bilaterally with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz  activity picked up in the T1-T2 electrodes. The activity seems to be slowing with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the temporal regions, with some field of spread to the right at\\\\n16:08:54.  The patient remains lying on his left side, paying attention to the left, with sporadic jerking  in the minutes that follow.   The background at 16:10 may be slower than previously identified.  Additional high amplitude left anterior temporal spikes are seen at 16:10, which is a non-sustained burst.  An individual enters and leaves the room at 16:13.  The individual can\\'t be heard on camera and seems to be just off camera.  Patient is noted to be somewhat tremulous and that individual\\'s  observation may be what led to the nurse entering the room at 16:19 and pushing the button.  Patient appears confused in this section of the record, with the caregiver holding his hand.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS  AND SLEEP:  Much of the drowsy record is a pattern of theta with small amounts of beta.  The trains of sharp waves and spikes seen from the left were not seen at those other times.\\\\nCLINICAL NOTE: The precise description of the behavior described in the nurse\\'s note is not possible to define. In the sleep recording, there were occasional sharp waves noted from the right with some independent right and left temporal sharp waves.  The alpha frequency activity picked up in the clinical seizure seen at 16:07 was not seen at any other time and differed substantially from  other  portions  of  the  record,  some  of  which  do  demonstrate  sustained  left  temporal discharges.  There are occasional left temporal sharp waves, but the majority are from the right.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, March 3, 2006 to 111arch 4, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates prominent portions of  the record with rhythmic continuous theta and sharply contoured slowing, as well as sharp waves from the left temporal region.  These include 14:37 when the patient gets up to go to the bathroom. At that time, there does seem to be some frequency evolution, the patient is with the\\\\nnurse who notes no clinical change.  While the patient is off camera in the bathroom, the EEG activity does seem to accelerate and afterwards the rhythmic slowing and sharp waves are less prominent.  Single channel artifact is then picked up at 14:46.\\\\nPush buttons for this 24-hour section are reviewed and no seizures are seen in association with the push buttons.\\\\nThe overnight recording for the patient is remarkable for sequential loss of electrodes and great amounts of artifact. Reviewing the seizure detection file, no additional seizures are identified.\\\\nLong-Term BEG Monitoring, March 4, 2006 to March 5, 2006\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has multiple push buttons when he is in need of  things.  These include 9:27 AM, 11:00, 11:02, and 13:35.  This section of the record includes many Stellate detections, all of which are artifact.  There are portions of the record with rhythmic mixed theta and delta.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 10:28:45: The patient is in bed on the morning of the 5th. He was previously asleep in stage II  sleep  with vertex wave, K complexes, and spindles.   In the time samples previous to this including 10:24, there are trains of spike and slow wave and sharp waves seen from the left temporal region.  There are rare sharp waves identified from the right.  Immediately prior to the discharge, there is some focal slowing and sharp waves, but not as persistent in nature as seen in other epochs of the record.  The first ictal change is seen at 10:28:45 with a burst of low voltage alpha/beta frequency activity.  This is in the left mid-to-posterior temporal regions, spreading to the posterior temporal region at 10:28:55 and then to the anterior temporal region ten seconds later.  The patient is lying on his side, under the sheets.  It is difficult to know which hand starts to tremble, but once the head starts to move at 10:29:25, it is clear that it is the right hand 20 seconds later.  The right hand extends and there are circular movements.  The right hand and then right leg demonstrate tonic and then tonic-clonic activity at 10:29:55. More generalized tonic-clonic activity is seen ten seconds later.  By 10:32:25, the ictal activity starts to slow with rhythmic paroxysmal slowing. The seizure demonstrates a clear paroxysmal pattern with slowing and a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.   The precise ending of the seizure is partly obscured  by muscle and movement artifact, but it seems to be over by 10:33:35.  The patient has a prolonged and profound postictal  period with  background  slowing.   The  video  indicates  a prolonged period where he is trying to sit up. He  seems to be having difficulty using his right side and he falls backwards in bed. He starts sliding out of bed at 10:39:05 and at 10:40:06 falls on the floor.  Shortly after this, the clinical team enters and notes that the patient is confused and cannot answer questions lucidly.  As the patient recovers, he is lying in bed and again the left temporal sharp and slow wave activity is identified.  The total seizure duration for this individual is approximately four minutes with a relatively prolonged onset prior to the first ictal change, with clear scalp localization in the temporal regions.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 18:10: The patient is sitting in a chair at 18:12:33. The nurse enters and hands the patient something. He takes medicine and swallows at 18:12:41. At 18:12:48, he has a cup of water and medicine in his hand.  The nurse is at the bedside.  At 18:12:54, there is a clear change in frequency of the background with this rhythmic, faster alpha frequency activity.  The patient is\\\\nsitting. The nurse is partially obscuring the patient  He seems to have some automatic behaviors on the right and the left.  The nurse can determine that something is wrong at 18:13:02 when he has an abrupt motor movement   Unfortunately, the nurse reaches across to help the patient and obscures the camera view of the patient   The nurse on the camera indicates that there is rapid, clonic activity at 18:13:11.  The video indicates that this is on the right   The patient seems to have partial impairment of awareness at 18:13:30 and 40, seemingly trying to help the nurse, but then by 18:13:45, this is much more generalized with vocalization.  The clinical team completely obscures the patient, but behind them he seems to be having a tonic-clonic seizure.  This seems to be asymmetric with much more significant tonic-clonic activity on the right compared to the left. The activity demonstrates frequency evolution, starting to slow at 18:14:25.  The patient remains slumped to the left side  at  18:14:36.   The precise  end of this seizure is a  little  difficult  to determine.   It is abating by 18:15:24 and is clearly over by 18:15:33.  Total seizure duration is three minutes.  Postictally, there is a fair amount of slowing in the background.  The EKG lead is obscured.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: There is a fair amount of movement artifact when the patient is up and out of bed.  The overall background when he is awake is slow on the right, and intermittently from the left hemisphere there are bursts and trains of left temporal focal slowing and spikes, most of which are in the mid-to-anterior temporal region.   There are also occasional  spike and slow wave complexes noted  from the right, particularly in the posterior temporal region.  This section of the overnight recording is remarkable for a fair amount of wakefulness captured late at night   On one or two occasions, he does seem to have an alpha rhythm on the right   The EKG lead is uninterpretable.  Notable in this section of the record are frequent  left  temporal  spikes.   Review of this section of the record, using the Stellate seizure detection software, identifies no additional clinical seizures with a burst of fast activity from the left temporal region.\\\\nIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.\\\\tLeft temporal focal slowing\\\\n2.\\\\tGeneralized slowing\\\\n3.\\\\tSharp waves, Tl/F7 spikes, right temporal rare sharps\\\\n4.\\\\tLeft TIRDA\\\\n5.\\\\tComplex partial seizures with generalization which begins with focal left temporal alpha beta activity\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION:\\\\nmechanism for epilepsy.\\\\nThis   EEG   IS     diagnostic   of   a   localization   related\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"',\n",

This jiggling behavior produces a return of the nurse to the bedside.  The audio is not working, but the behavior seems to stop on its own.  The waking background is remarkable for excess beta and excess theta, particularly after an infusion of multiple sedative hypnotic medications.  There are rare bursts of left temporal focal slowing with sharp waves seen primarily on the 23rd.  Stage II sleep is remarkable for vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and multiple arousals from sleep.  There was little in the way of epileptiform activity on the 24th; in fact, the focal features were really primarily seen in the baseline and in the first section of the recording.

The patient experienced one seizure.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 17:00: The patient is awake and undergoing neurologic testing.  The physician is at the bedside.  Unfortunately, the patient unplugs himself during the seizure.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT: The patient is speaking.  They are conducting a mental status examination.  At 17:02:09, the patient shifts.  Because there is a clinical team present, it is clear that there is a change in behavior that is not part of a normal pattern of behavior.  As he shifts at 17:02:09, there isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a clear ictal change.  There is frequent eye blinking and a bit of attenuation.  By 17:02:19, there is clear ictal behavior with head turning to the left, automatisms of the left, and despite a great deal of movement artifact, there is some underlying theta from the right hemisphere identified from both the temporal regions, which can be seen with the 35 Hz filter and the notched filter.  The left, unfortunately, has a fair amount of muscle, but the activity seems to be more intense on the right compared to the left, again with a caveat with the problems with muscle on the left.  The T1/T2 electrodes are also involved.  By 10:02:45, the activity has started to generalize and the patient is demonstrating more of a flexed than a typical tonic position and then tonic-clonic activity.  The patient is lying on his back.  The EEG looks more like tonic activity, but behaviorally is more subtle motor with his hand in a flexed position.  The seizure ends at 17:02:33.  Significant postictal slowing is identified.  The patient is agitated at 17:04 and the EEG becomes unplugged.  There is a delay and then the patient is re-plugged in later on.\\\\nEVENT TIME 20:17:11: The patient is in the room walking about.  There is a little bit of left temporal theta.  Unfortunately, there is also some muscle on the right.

       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 20-year-old woman with recent onset epilepsy and seizures, which often can be eliminated by the patient with reassurance.  The patient had six seizures after she ran out of her Effexor.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 23:30:38: The patient is drowsy and alerts from sleep. An arousal is seen at 22:31:38.  She takes off the covers, reaches for the push button. Hands are raised to her side and she starts flapping them from side to side.  There may be a very subtle asymmetry with perhaps a bit more fluid flapping from the left than the right.  Tachycardia is seen with association with the flapping at 22:33:08.  She is flapping and although the video isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t optimal in terms of the facial automatisms, it looks as if there may be some oral automatisms associated with this.  When the nurses come in at 22:32:11, the patient can look at them and when they ask if she is okay, she nods yes.  At 22:32:38, immediately as the event ends, either the nurse or the patient say that the seizure is over.\\\\nThe EEG during this event does have an electrographic signature.  It is best reviewed with a notched filter on and a high frequency filter of 35.  There is an arousal at 22:31:41 with a suggestion of a sharp wave at that time.  With eye movements, there is likely an underlying pair of sharp waves at T1 as well.  Just before the patient starts with arm flapping, although there is some movement artifact, there is high amplitude rhythmic delta from the left temporal region and this can clearly be delineated from 22:31:43 through 22:31:57.  At this point, as the motor activity is more vigorous, the EEG is obscured.  Looking at the left frontocentral region, there aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t definitive frontocentral spike waves noted.  Despite the movement artifact, there is this focal delta from the left temporal region with a generous field of spread and attenuation of the alpha.  There seems to be generalized background slowing at 22:32:40 and at 22:32:47, the seizure seems to be over with little in the way of postictal changes.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  The majority of the epileptiform discharges in this section of the record are in stage II sleep.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, September 12-13, 2006\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient initially reported that she did not have any seizures, but with review of the EEG monitoring data, one event was noted and was reviewed with the patient.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized pattern with a 9.5 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a great deal of eye artifact picked up in wakefulness.\\\\nRANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: Two artifacts are seen in the early portions of the morning - this is also seen at mealtimes.  In wakefulness, there are rare spike and slow wave complexes identified, particularly when the awake record is observed in the late evening or nighttime hours.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Epileptiform activity can be seen in the transition to and from sleep, and sleep seems to be fragmented for this individual.\\\\nSEIZURE TIME 23:22:34:  The patient is drowsy in the transition to and from wakefulness to early drowsiness.  The seizure begins with a left anteriotemporal T1 maximum spike and slow wave complex identified at 23:22:34 followed by an arousal at 23:22:38.  Behaviorally, this seizure is similar to the seizure 24 hours prior to this.  The patient takes off the covers and begins flapping her arms from side to side as if to cool herself down.  Looking at the video, she seems to remain awake and alert.  It is not possible to see any oral automatisms.  She also seems to have relatively purposeful behavior.  At one point, she doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t slap on the right, but she does slap on the left; however, it doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem as if she has dystonic posturing on the right.  She also has alternative movements of the arms.  The behavior is over at 23:33:44.  The seizure seems to be over at the same time with a seizure duration of one minute, ten seconds.\\\\nEEG correlates for this seizure include the initial left anteriotemporal spike followed by arousal.  The flapping movements produce a great deal of artifact.  However, even prior to the flapping movements, there is rhythmic 2 to 3 Hz delta picked up from the left temporal region beginning at 23:22:39 and continuing, although there is artifact at 22:50 to 23:22:60.  With the use of filters, it is clear that in this seizure, despite the movement artifact, there is a left frontocentral (F3/C3) high amplitude spike complex, which is identifiable as earlier as 23:23:09 with a periodicity of approximately 1.5 Hz.  Using the filters, the spike activity can be seen although it doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t clearly evolve and it doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t correlate with the rate at which she flaps her arms.   It does seem to increase in intensity and then to dissipate at 23:23:36.  Careful review of the time samples that follow suggest that there is some subtle in the left temporal region that follows.  The left central spike activity was not identified later on in the record, and the patient drifts off to sleep.  Five minutes later, the nurse enters and checks the patient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood pressure and temperature. Tachycardia is seen in association with the seizure only and the heart rate seems to increase at the beginning of the discharge.\\\\nLong-Term EEG Monitoring, September 13, 2006\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Topiramate.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.

She recalls feeling hot during the seizures and hence she recalls flapping her arms back and forth to cool herself.  Looking at the video during the first seizure, there may well have been subtle impairment of awareness with that seizure, and there may have also been facial automatisms.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",

This recording is performed for a child with a chronic static encephalopathy who is responsive in an attempt to make sure that no subclinical seizures occur as medications are tapered.  This is a 6.5 hour EEG. There is no seizure log. In the EEG itself, there are no push button events, and the computer does not identify electrographic seizures.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG is remarkable for a moderate degree of artifact.  While the child has been described as responsive, he seems to be sleeping throughout much of the EEG with occipitally predominant delta.  The overall background is rich in delta and beta.  The awake recording for this child is remarkable for an extraordinary amount of background beta particularly in the frontal regions.  As the recording continues, the child is increasingly active.  At times, there is what is likely artifact identified as a single-channel phenomena in the T1-T2 channel, which is alpha frequency in nature.  What may well be the sleep record is characterized by posterior delta and frontal beta.  Compatible with the reduction of anesthetic medications, as the recording continues, the child is more active.  There are portions of the record with focal beta activity, which is asymmetric, seen much more prominent in the right frontal regions than the left, although the beta is extraordinary in both hemispheres.\\\\nHR:  116 BPM.\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\nReplacement of normal background for a child of this age with a pattern of prominent occipital delta and generous frontal fast activity.\\\\nAn intermittent asymmetry with more remarkable fast activity from the right frontal region.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were identified in this record.

It must be noted, however, that when the technologist tells the patient to close his\\\\neyes he does not do it and he continues to move around and blink. For the 11:29 event, the patient knocks off one of his EEG electrodes and then lies back. The technologist does not seem to have observed that change.

Electrode placement had to be modified to some extent due to the patient\\'s facial injuries.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates  an abnormal pattern. The activity from the right hemisphere is slow with beta and delta. The left hemisphere once again demonstrates a left occipital spike focus with intermittent  fast activity superimposed. This activity builds up. Recurrent seizures are observed and are characterized by left occipital spiking associated with some lower voltage faster alpha and theta frequency activity, followed by paroxysmal evolution and slowing of the occipital spiking. On some occasions, facial twitching is observed, but not on every occasion. The technologist performed noxious stimulation, unfortunately  during one of the patient\\'s seizures. No variability or reactivity is seen. Ocular stimuli unfortunately  also is performed around the time of the seizure.\\\\nHR: \\\\t78 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1.

Video EEG was employed with seizure and spike detection. This 72 hour continuous LTM study.\\\\nThere was on clinical history provided, no medication list and no documentation that the\\\\npatient\\'s clinical seizures were observed by the team.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  November 16, 2007 to November 17, 2007. As the tracing opens, the patient has been intubated and received vecuronium. The background EEG is quite slow.\\\\nSeizure: Time 12:43. The nurse suctions the patient. Following this , nodding and jerking is observed. As the nodding and jerking resolves, no clinical signs or symptoms are observed, but rhythmic repetitive  delta with sharp waves maximum in the left temporal region are observed at 11:44:13. The video is reviewed. There are no clinical signs or symptoms. The activity slows over the course of 5 minutes and is abating by\\\\n12:45:19.\\\\nSeizure time 17:38. The patient is resting comfortably. Somebody has been in and out of the room as can be heard with some background noise. There is some sharply delta in the T1 and T2. By 17:40, the patient begins to have head nodding and jerking first of the head and then upper extremities and then the lower extremities. The jerking is relatively prolong and is persistent at 17:46. The activity begin to slow by 17:48. It has returned by 19:32. No clinical correlates are observed in association with these symptoms.\\\\nBy midnight, this pattern seems to have resolved.\\\\nThe background EEG throughout this section of the record demonstrates a low voltage pattern with some faster frequency activity and some delta. No additional clinical seizures are observed.\\\\nNovember 17, 2007 to November 18, 2007. As the tracing opens, there is a fair amount of muscle artifact observed. Behaviorally, the patient has head turned to the right. It is difficult to determine he if has any jerky at that time and the electrode integrity is quite poor. As the day continues, the background EEG is very low voltage and suppressed. There are problems with electrode artifact at T1 and T2, but no additional seizures are observed. The seizure and spike detector is reviewed and no additional electrographic seizures are observed although at times, the quality of the data is suboptimal.\\\\nDate November 18, 2007 to November 19, 2007. Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside in ICU. There are no clinical notations regarding seizures. Intermittently, the caliber of the EEG data is suboptimal.\\\\nThe background EEG is low voltage, continuous with some artifact in the T1 and T2 electrodes. No epileptiform features are seen in this section of the record.\\\\nHR: \\\\t84 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This inpatient video EEG monitoring was remarkable for seizures in the first 24 hours of the record some of which were clearly apparent with jerking. Others were characterized by left temporal rhythmic activity. Additional clinical information is essential to known how and why this seizures stopped.\\\\nCLINICAL  CORRELATION:In terms of the overall background, this pattern is worrisome following cardiac arrest due to the significant degree of background slowing, however, this is of unclear clinical significance in that we so not know what medications were employed at this time.

The patient does have eye movement.\\\\nThe patient received a bath at 11 a.m. No spontaneous movements are observed, eye opening is observed the background EEG is continuous with beta frequent activity and lower voltage delta and theta. There is clear variability and there is a bit more beta activity  in the frontal regions.\\\\nAs the recording continues, very low voltage pattern is observed. There is a small bifrontal sharp wave observed, left greater than right. This reaches the maximum of 40 microvolts. This is primarily seen when the patient is drowsy.\\\\nHR: \\\\t84 bpm\\\\nIMPRESSION:  This 6 hour continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:\\\\n1. \\\\tMarkedly abnormal background.\\\\n2. \\\\tOccasional frontal sharp wave, left greater than 4.\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: For an individual now 4-5 days status post anoxic event, this is an encouraging pattern and is continuous with reactivity and variability. The epileptiform activity has abated considerably. No seizure were recorded. This is a technically unsatisfactory recording because there is no historical information and no listing of patient\\'s medications.

The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background includes a pattern of low voltage or mixed frequency theta and delta. There is frontal, sharply contoured activity with 2 different morphologies in the right and left frontal region. There is a bit more faster frontal activity on the left than the right. As the recording continues , the left frontal periodic complex emerges maximum P1, F3. In addition, as this emerges, over the first 20 seconds that it is seen, rhythmic theta frequency activity begins to develop in this background. There is a mixture of theta alpha and then sharp waves with some\\\\nevolution of the sharp waves. The first sign of an ictal pattern is seen at 13:04:13. By 13:07:11 a more definitive ictal discharge appears again, left frontal maximum. At 13:08: 15, the tech raises the question as to whether or not these are clinical seizures. Ongoing ictal activity which waxes and wanes and includes some alpha frequency activity can be observed in the left frontal central region. There is some spread to the right frontal region, but the majority of the activity is in the left. The use of frontal and parasagittal montage clearly delineates the left frontal epileptiform activity which waxes and wanes and seems to have frequency evolution with alpha and beta frequency activity.

       " \"b'CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old woman with seizures and atrial fibrillation.\\\\nMEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Coumadin.\\\\nINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is having a seizure just as the EEG is hooked up. The seizure is characterized by chewing movements.\\\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the EEG shows periodic sharp waves are noted in the background with frontal delta and a periodic complex that seems to be emanating from the right hemisphere particularly the posterior region. There is also notched frontal delta. The activity is present in the initial section of the record lasting about 60 seconds and then terminates abruptly. As it terminates, the background demonstrates a low voltage suppressed pattern. Within minutes, a second seizure begins which is poorly localized, but may start with left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave followed by suppression and then replacement of the preexisting background with sharply contoured theta. This is present bilaterally, but there does seem to be a phase reversal on the left temporal electrodes. This also ends abruptly and seems to end with stimulation. Interestingly, this 15 second discharge ends on the right before the left. The discharges reappear lasting less than a minute and then are followed by background suppression. As the recording continues, additional electrographic seizures are noted which are clearly maximum in the left hemisphere with repetitive sharp activity T3. Most seizures are less than a minute in duration. Typical characteristics are chewing and movement of the head.\\\\nHR: 120 bpm and irregular\\\\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:\\\\n1. Electrographic pattern compatible with complex partial status epilepticus out of the left, mid temporal region\\\\nCLINICAL CORRELATION: The clinical team was notified. The long term EEG monitoring was arranged for this patient urgently.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n",
